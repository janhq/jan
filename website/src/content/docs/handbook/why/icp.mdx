# Who we are building for

Jan is built for people who value privacy, ownership, and freedom in their AI interactions. Our users span from individual creators to enterprise teams, united by a common belief: AI should augment human capability without compromising human agency.

## Primary Users

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals
People who understand that their thoughts, ideas, and conversations should remain private:
- Researchers working on sensitive topics
- Writers and creators protecting their intellectual property  
- Professionals handling confidential information
- Anyone who believes their AI conversations shouldn't train someone else's models

### Local-First Developers
Engineers and developers who need:
- Full control over their AI infrastructure
- The ability to run models offline and air-gapped
- Customizable, hackable AI tools
- Integration with their existing workflows via our API

### Global Users with Limited Internet
Millions of potential AI users who face:
- Unreliable or expensive internet connections
- Geographical restrictions on AI services
- The need for AI that works anywhere, anytime
- Language and cultural barriers with centralized services

### Organizations Requiring Data Sovereignty
Companies and institutions that cannot use cloud AI due to:
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Data residency laws
- Security policies prohibiting external data transmission
- The need for complete audit trails and control

## Our North Star: Quality for Everyone

We use **Jan Exam** as our benchmark to ensure that whether you're using our models or any model from our hub, you're getting the best possible experience. We believe that:

- Quality shouldn't be gated behind subscriptions
- The best models should be accessible to everyone
- Open models can and will outperform closed ones
- Community-driven development leads to better outcomes

## What We're NOT Building For

We're explicitly not building for:
- Surveillance or monitoring use cases
- Applications that violate user privacy
- "Nice-to-have" enterprise vanity projects
- Use cases that require sacrificing user control

## The Future User

Ultimately, we're building for the next billion AI users who haven't yet experienced what AI can do. They'll start with AI that respects their privacy, runs on their devices, and belongs to them from day one.

We're creating the platform where AI literacy begins with AI ownership.

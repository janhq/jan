# Our Vision for Open Superintelligence

Jan believes that the path to beneficial superintelligence is through openness, community ownership, and universal access. We're not just building another AI platform—we're creating the foundation for AI that truly belongs to its users.

## What is Open Superintelligence?

Open superintelligence means:

- **Open Source**: Every line of code is public, auditable, and forkable
- **Open Weights**: Models that can be downloaded, modified, and owned
- **Open Standards**: Protocols like MCP that anyone can implement
- **Open Participation**: A global community building together

## Why Ownership Matters

When you use Jan, you own:

### Your Conversations
- No company reads your chats
- No AI trains on your prompts
- Your data stays on your device
- Export and move your data anytime

### Your Models
- Download once, use forever
- No subscription required
- Modify and fine-tune as needed
- Share with your community

### Your Compute
- Run on your hardware
- No cloud dependency
- Scale as you need
- Control your costs

## The Platform Approach

We're building Jan as a platform where:

- **Best Models Win**: Whether it's our Jan v1 model or community models, we showcase what performs best on Jan Exam
- **Innovation Thrives**: Developers can build on top of Jan without permission
- **Standards Emerge**: Open protocols ensure no vendor lock-in
- **Communities Flourish**: Users help users, models improve models

## Community Ownership

Jan is built by and for its community:

### Open Development
- Public roadmap and planning
- Community input on features
- Transparent decision making
- Open source contributions welcome

### Shared Success
- Models improved by the community
- Features requested by users
- Quality benchmarked transparently
- Success measured by adoption, not extraction

## The Path Forward

We envision a future where:

1. **Every device runs AI**: From phones to laptops to embedded systems
2. **Every person owns AI**: Not rented, not surveilled, but truly owned
3. **Every community contributes**: Local models for local needs
4. **Every innovation is shared**: Improvements benefit everyone

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

- **Stay Open**: Jan will always have an open-source version
- **Stay Private**: We will never read your data or conversations
- **Stay Accessible**: Supporting diverse hardware and use cases
- **Stay Community-Driven**: Your needs drive our development

## Join Us

- Use Jan for private conversations
- Contribute code or models
- Share feedback and ideas
- Tell others about local AI

The future of AI shouldn't be controlled by a few corporations. It should be owned by everyone who uses it. That's the future we're building at Jan.

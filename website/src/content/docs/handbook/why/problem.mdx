# What problem are we solving?

Current AI platforms have fundamental problems:

- **Centralized Control**: Your conversations, data, and AI capabilities are controlled by a few companies
- **Privacy Violations**: Every prompt you type is stored, analyzed, and used to train models
- **Internet Dependency**: No connection means no AI - even for simple tasks
- **Subscription Lock-in**: Pay monthly forever or lose access to your own conversations
- **Limited Choice**: Stuck with one model provider's capabilities and biases

## Mission

Jan is building an open superintelligence platform that runs locally, privately, and offline. We believe AI should be:

- **Yours to Own**: Download it once, use it forever
- **Private by Default**: Your thoughts stay on your device
- **Open and Flexible**: Use any model, from any provider, or none at all
- **Universally Accessible**: Works on any hardware, anywhere in the world

## Approach

We're building the full stack for open superintelligence:

- **Jan Desktop**: Local AI that runs on your computer today
- **Jan Models**: Our own models optimized for privacy and performance
- **Model Hub**: Access to the best open-source models, quantized and ready to use
- **Jan Exam**: Rigorous evaluation to ensure quality across all models
- **Advanced Features**: 
  - Attachments for document understanding
  - DeepResearch for comprehensive analysis
  - Voice Mode for natural conversations
  - Tool calling via MCP for real-world capabilities

## Why This Matters

In 5 years, AI will be as essential as electricity. The question is: will you rent it from a monopoly, or will you own it?

We're ensuring the answer is ownership. Every feature we build, every model we support, every line of code we write is in service of this goal.

## Vision

We envision a future where:

- AI augments human intelligence without compromising privacy
- Anyone can run superintelligence on their personal devices
- Open models outperform closed ones through community collaboration
- The next billion users experience AI on their own terms, not Silicon Valley's

Jan is the platform that makes this future possible.

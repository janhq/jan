Jan is evolving from a local AI application to a complete full-stack AI solution that you can
self-host. This includes models, applications, and tools to solve real problems.

## What We're Building

**Jan Agent** = Jan Models + Jan Application + Jan Tools

Unlike other AI assistants that do specific tasks with one model or have many models with
a myriad of solutions, Jan provides:
- Our own models optimized for local and private use. As of now, we have Jan Nano in 2 flavors and
Lucy but more are coming soon
- Applications that work across all your devices
- Tools that actually get things done

## Two Modes, One Experience

### Local (Incognito) Mode
This mode allows you to run AI models entirely on your device, giving you complete
privacy with no internet required.

### Cloud Mode
Connect to more powerful models when needed - either self-hosted or via jan.ai.

<Aside type="tip" title="We understand that...">
Users shouldn't need to understand models, APIs, or technical details. Just choose Local for privacy or Cloud for power.

## Our Product Principles

### It Just Works
1. Open Jan, start chatting.
2. Onboarding is fully available but optional.
3. Setting up an API key is optional
4. Selecting a local model is optional.

> We handle the complexity.

### Privacy First, Cloud When Needed
Start with complete privacy by default. Add cloud capabilities only when you choose to.

### Solve Problems, Not Settings
Users want answers, not configuration options. Power users can dig deeper, but it's never required.

## What Makes Jan Different

| Feature | Other AI Assistants | Jan |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| Models | Wrapper around Claude/GPT | Our own models + others |
| Dual mode  | Your data on their servers | Your data stays yours |
| Deployment | Cloud only | Local, self-hosted, or cloud |
| Cost | Subscription forever | Free locally, pay for cloud |

## The Roadmap Simplified

### Today
- Desktop app with local models
- Basic cloud connections
- Developer-friendly API

### Next 6 Months
- Simplified Local/Cloud modes
- jan.ai cloud service
- Mobile apps
- Self-hosted server

### Future Vision
- Complete AI Agent platform
- Compete directly with Claude/ChatGPT
- Open superintelligence

<Aside type="tip">
We're building AI that respects your choices. Run it locally for privacy, connect to cloud for power, or self-host for both.

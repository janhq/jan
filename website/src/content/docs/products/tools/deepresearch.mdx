Deep Research provides comprehensive investigation capabilities beyond simple search. It reads sources, synthesizes information, and produces analysis with proper citations.

## Research Levels

| Level | Duration | Sources | Output | Use Case |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| Quick | 5 min | 10-20 | Summary with key points | Overview needed |
| Standard | 30 min | 20-50 | Detailed analysis | Work projects |
| Comprehensive | 2+ hours | 50-200 | Full literature review | Academic research |

## How It Works

### Research Pipeline
1. **Query Analysis**: Understand scope and requirements
2. **Source Discovery**: Find relevant materials
3. **Content Extraction**: Read and process sources
4. **Synthesis**: Connect information across sources
5. **Output Generation**: Create structured analysis

## How It Works

Jan Mobile adapts to your situation:

| At Home | At Work | On the Go |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Connect to your Jan Desktop over WiFi | Connect to company Jan Server | Run Jan Nano locally on your phone |

No configuration needed. It just works.

## Three Modes, One Experience

### Desktop Mode
When you're near your computer, your phone uses its models and processing power.

```
Your Phone → WiFi → Your Desktop → Response
             (automatic)  (powerful models)
```

**Benefits:**
- Access to larger models
- Faster processing
- Shared conversations
- No phone battery drain

### Server Mode
Connect to your organization's Jan Server for team collaboration.

```
Your Phone → Internet → Company Server → Response
             (secure)    (shared models)
```

**Benefits:**
- Team knowledge base
- Consistent models
- Central management
- Work anywhere

### Local Mode
No connection? No problem. Jan Nano runs directly on your phone.

```
Your Phone → Jan Nano (6GB) → Response
             (private & offline)
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete privacy
- Works offline
- No data usage
- Always available

<Aside type="tip">
The app automatically switches between modes based on what's available. You don't need to do anything.

### No Compromises
- Biometric app lock
- Encrypted storage
- No cloud backups without permission
- Clear data anytime

## Common Questions

### Do I need to download models to my phone?
No. In Desktop or Server mode, models run remotely. For Local Mode, Jan Nano downloads automatically when needed (6GB).

### How fast is Local Mode?
On modern phones, expect 30-50 tokens per second. Good enough for most conversations.

### Can I use it without Jan Desktop?
Yes. Use Local Mode or connect to jan.ai (when available).

### Will it drain my battery?
Desktop/Server modes use minimal battery. Local Mode is like using any intensive app - noticeable but manageable.

### Is it the same as desktop?
Same Jan, smaller screen. All the privacy, none of the complexity.

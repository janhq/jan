jan.ai is our cloud service that brings powerful AI to your browser and powers Cloud Mode in Jan Desktop and Mobile.

## What is jan.ai?

jan.ai is the hosted version of Jan Server. Same models, same experience, but running in the cloud when you need more power than your device can provide.

## Why Use jan.ai?

## For Developers

### API Access
```javascript
// Same API as local Jan
const response = await fetch('https://api.jan.ai/v1/chat/completions', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_KEY' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'jan-v1-70b',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }]
  })
});
```

### OpenAI Compatible
Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API:
```python
# Just change the base URL
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.jan.ai/v1",
    api_key="your-jan-key"
)
```

## Common Questions

More private than most cloud AI:

<Aside type="note">
jan.ai is designed to feel exactly like local Jan, just faster. If you notice the difference (besides speed), we've failed.

## The Philosophy

Cloud AI doesn't have to mean giving up control. jan.ai proves you can have:
- Convenience without surveillance
- Power without privacy invasion
- Simplicity without lock-in

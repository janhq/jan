# MCP Introduction & Setup

Welcome to the world of Model Context Protocol! This foundational video explains what MCPs are, why they're revolutionary for AI applications, and how to get them set up in your Jan installation.

<List title="Prerequisites" variant="caution" icon="warning">
- Jan installed and working properly
- Downloaded at least one model
- Basic understanding of APIs and web services
- Administrative access to your computer
</List>

## What You'll Learn

- **MCP Fundamentals**: What MCPs are and how they work
- **Architecture Overview**: How MCPs connect AI to external systems
- **Setup Process**: Enabling MCP support in Jan
- **Configuration Basics**: Understanding MCP settings and options
- **Verification**: Testing that MCPs are working correctly

## Understanding MCPs

### What is Model Context Protocol?
Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools, APIs, and services. Think of it as a bridge that allows your AI to:

- **Access Real-Time Data**: Get current information from the web
- **Execute Code**: Run programs and scripts safely
- **Interact with APIs**: Connect to third-party services
- **Process Files**: Work with documents and media
- **Perform Actions**: Make changes to external systems

### Why MCPs Matter
- **Extended Capabilities**: Go beyond text generation
- **Real-World Integration**: Connect AI to your existing tools
- **Customization**: Build workflows specific to your needs
- **Standardization**: Use a consistent protocol across services

## MCP Architecture Deep Dive

### Core Components
1. **MCP Client**: Jan's built-in MCP handler
2. **MCP Server**: External services that provide capabilities
3. **Transport Layer**: How messages are exchanged
4. **Schema Definition**: How capabilities are described

### Communication Flow
```
Jan (MCP Client) ←→ Transport ←→ MCP Server ←→ External Service
```

### Security Model
- **Sandboxed Execution**: MCPs run in isolated environments
- **Permission System**: Granular control over what MCPs can access
- **Authentication**: Secure connection to external services
- **Audit Logging**: Track all MCP interactions

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Check Jan Version
<List title="Version Requirements" variant="note" icon="information">
- Jan 0.5.0 or later required
- Latest version recommended for best features
- Check Help → About Jan for your version
</List>

### 2. Enable MCP Support
- Navigate to Jan Settings
- Find the "Extensions" or "MCP" section
- Toggle "Enable Model Context Protocol"
- Restart Jan if prompted

### 3. Configure MCP Directory
- Set the directory where MCP servers will be stored
- Choose a location with adequate disk space
- Ensure Jan has read/write permissions

### 4. Initial MCP Installation
- Browse the MCP marketplace
- Install a simple MCP (like system info)
- Verify the installation completed successfully

### 5. Test Your Setup
- Start a new conversation
- Try using the installed MCP
- Verify responses include MCP data

## Configuration Options

### MCP Settings Overview
- **Enable/Disable**: Global MCP toggle
- **Server Directory**: Where MCP servers are stored
- **Timeout Settings**: How long to wait for MCP responses
- **Security Settings**: Permission and access controls
- **Logging Level**: How much detail to log

### Performance Tuning
- **Concurrent Connections**: How many MCPs can run simultaneously
- **Memory Limits**: Resource constraints for MCP servers
- **Cache Settings**: Storing MCP responses for faster access
- **Network Configuration**: Proxy and firewall settings

## Common Setup Issues

### Problem: MCPs Not Loading
**Solutions:**
- Check Jan version compatibility
- Verify MCP directory permissions
- Review Jan logs for error messages
- Restart Jan after configuration changes

### Problem: Connection Timeouts
**Solutions:**
- Increase timeout settings
- Check internet connection
- Verify API credentials
- Test with simpler MCPs first

### Problem: Permission Errors
**Solutions:**
- Run Jan as administrator (if needed)
- Check folder permissions
- Review security software blocking
- Verify antivirus exceptions

## Verification Checklist

<List title="Setup Verification" variant="success" icon="approve-check">
- MCP toggle is enabled in settings
- MCP directory is configured and accessible
- At least one MCP is installed successfully
- MCP responds correctly in conversations
- No error messages in Jan logs
</List>

## What's Next?

Once your MCP setup is complete, you're ready for **Enabling Your First MCP**, where we'll walk through installing and configuring your first real-world MCP integration.

## Pro Tips

- Start with simple MCPs before moving to complex integrations
- Keep your MCPs updated for security and functionality
- Monitor resource usage when running multiple MCPs
- Join the Discord community for MCP-specific support

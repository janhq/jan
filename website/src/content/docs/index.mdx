## Jan's Goal

> Jan's goal is to build superintelligence that you can self-host and use locally.

## What is Jan?

Jan is an open-source AI ecosystem that runs on your hardware. We're building towards open superintelligence - a complete AI platform you actually own.

### The Ecosystem

**Models**: We build specialized models for real tasks, not general-purpose assistants:
- **Jan-Nano (32k/128k)**: 4B parameters designed for deep research with MCP. The 128k version processes entire papers, codebases, or legal documents in one go
- **Lucy**: 1.7B model that runs agentic web search on your phone. Small enough for CPU, smart enough for complex searches
- **Jan-v1**: 4B model for agentic reasoning and tool use, achieving 91.1% on SimpleQA

We also integrate the best open-source models - from OpenAI's gpt-oss to community GGUF models on Hugging Face. The goal: make powerful AI accessible to everyone, not just those with server farms.

**Applications**: Jan Desktop runs on your computer today. Web, mobile, and server versions coming in late 2025. Everything syncs, everything works together.

**Tools**: Connect to the real world through [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Design with Canva, analyze data in Jupyter notebooks, control browsers, execute code in E2B sandboxes. Your AI can actually do things, not just talk about them.

<Aside type="tip">
API keys are optional. No account needed. Just download and run. Bring your own API keys to connect your favorite cloud models.
</Aside>

## Core Features

### Run Models Locally
- Download any GGUF model from Hugging Face
- Use OpenAI's gpt-oss models (120b and 20b)
- Automatic GPU acceleration (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel/Apple Silicon)
- OpenAI-compatible API at `localhost:1337`

### Connect to Cloud (Optional)
- Your API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- Jan.ai cloud models (coming late 2025)
- Self-hosted Jan Server (soon)

### Extend with MCP Tools
Growing ecosystem of real-world integrations:
- **Creative Work**: Generate designs with Canva
- **Data Analysis**: Execute Python in Jupyter notebooks
- **Web Automation**: Control browsers with Browserbase and Browser Use
- **Code Execution**: Run code safely in E2B sandboxes
- **Search & Research**: Access current information via Exa, Perplexity, and Octagon
- **More coming**: The MCP ecosystem is expanding rapidly

## Architecture

Jan is built on:
- [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for inference
- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for tool integration
- Local-first data storage in `~/jan`

## Why Jan?

| Feature | Other AI Platforms | Jan |
|:--------|:-------------------|:----|
| **Deployment** | Their servers only | Your device, your servers, or our cloud |
| **Models** | One-size-fits-all | Specialized models for specific tasks |
| **Data** | Stored on their servers | Stays on your hardware |
| **Cost** | Monthly subscription | Free locally, pay for cloud |
| **Extensibility** | Limited APIs | Full ecosystem with MCP tools |
| **Ownership** | You rent access | You own everything |

## Development Philosophy

1. **Local First**: Everything works offline. Cloud is optional.
2. **User Owned**: Your data, your models, your compute.
3. **Built in Public**: Watch our models train. See our code. Track our progress.

<Aside>
We're building AI that respects your choices. Not another wrapper around someone else's API.
</Aside>

## System Requirements

**Minimum**: 8GB RAM, 10GB storage  
**Recommended**: 16GB RAM, GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel), 50GB storage  
**Supported**: Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

## What's Next?

<details>
<summary><strong>What are MCP tools?</strong></summary>

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI interact with real applications. Instead of just generating text, your AI can:
- Create designs in Canva
- Analyze data in Jupyter notebooks
- Browse and interact with websites
- Execute code in sandboxes
- Search the web for current information

All through natural language conversation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does Jan make money?</strong></summary>

- **Local use**: Always free
- **Cloud features**: Optional paid services (coming late 2025)
- **Enterprise**: Self-hosted deployment and support

We don't sell your data. We sell software and services.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I contribute?</strong></summary>

Yes. Everything is open:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/janhq/jan) - Code contributions
- [Model Training](https://jan.ai/docs/models) - See how we train
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/FTk2MvZwJH) - Join discussions
- [Model Testing](https://eval.jan.ai) - Help evaluate models
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this just another AI wrapper?</strong></summary>

No. We're building:
- Our own models trained for specific tasks
- Complete local AI infrastructure
- Tools that extend model capabilities via MCP
- An ecosystem that works offline

Other platforms are models behind APIs you rent. Jan is a complete AI platform you own.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about privacy?</strong></summary>

**Local mode**: Your data never leaves your device. Period.  
**Cloud mode**: You choose when to use cloud features. Clear separation.

See our [Privacy Policy](./privacy).

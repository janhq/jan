## Jan's Goal

> We're working towards open superintelligence that will be a viable open-source alternative to
platforms like ChatGPT and Claude that anyone can own and run.

## What is Jan Today

Jan is an open-source AI platform that runs on your hardware. We believe AI should be in the
hands of many, not controlled by a few tech giants.

Today, Jan is:
- **A desktop app** that runs AI models locally or connects to cloud providers
- **A model hub** making the latest open-source models accessible
- **A connector system** that lets AI interact with real-world tools via MCPs
- **A testing framework** that evaluates model quality transparently

Tomorrow, Jan aims to be a complete ecosystem where open models rival or exceed closed alternatives.

<Aside type="note">
We're building this with the open-source AI community, using the best available tools, and
sharing everything we learn along the way.

## The Jan Ecosystem

### Jan Apps
**Available Now:**
- **Desktop**: Full-featured AI workstation for Windows, Mac, and Linux

**Coming Late 2025:**
- **Mobile**: Jan on your phone
- **Web**: Browser-based access at jan.ai
- **Extensions**: Excel, Word, and browser integrations

### Jan Model Hub
Making open-source AI accessible to everyone:
- **Easy Downloads**: One-click model installation
- **Jan Models**: Our own models optimized for local use
- **Jan-v1**: 4B reasoning model for web search
  **Research Models**:
    - **Jan-Nano (32k/128k)**: 4B model for web search with MCP tools
    - **Lucy**: 1.7B mobile-optimized for web search
- **Community Models**: Any GGUF from Hugging Face
- **Cloud Models**: Connect your API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

Each model comes with transparent evaluations through Jan Exam.

### Jan Connectors Hub
Connect AI to the tools you use daily via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io):

**Creative & Design:**
- **Canva**: Generate and edit designs

**Data & Analysis:**
- **Jupyter**: Run Python notebooks
- **E2B**: Execute code in sandboxes

**Web & Search:**
- **Browserbase**: Browser automation
- **Exa & Serper**: Advanced web search
- **Octagon**: Deep research capabilities

**Productivity:**
- **Linear**: Project management
- **Todoist**: Task management

More connectors are added regularly by the community.

### Jan Exam
Transparent model evaluation:
- Real-world benchmarks
- Community-driven testing
- Public results for all models
- No cherry-picked metrics

### Jan Family of Models
We're training specialized models optimized for local devices:
- **Speech Models**: Like Ichigo for voice interactions
- **Web Search Models**: Like Jan-v1 with tool use and reasoning
- **Other Task-Specific Models**: Optimized for search, writing, analysis

These take the best of open source and tailor them for real-world use on consumer hardware.

## Why Jan?

| Feature | Big Tech AI | Jan |
|:--------|:------------|:----|
| **Control** | They control access | You own everything |
| **Data** | Stored on their servers | Stays on your device |
| **Models** | One-size-fits-all | Choose from many options |
| **Cost** | Monthly subscription | Free locally, optional cloud |
| **Tools** | Limited integrations | Growing MCP ecosystem |
| **Transparency** | Black box | Open source, open evals |

## The Path Forward

### What Works Today
- Run powerful models locally on consumer hardware
- Connect to any cloud provider with your API keys
- Use MCP tools for real-world tasks
- Access transparent model evaluations

### What We're Building
- More specialized models that excel at specific tasks
- Expanded app ecosystem (mobile, web, extensions)
- Richer connector ecosystem
- Models that approach or exceed GPT-4 class performance

### The Long-Term Vision
We're working towards open superintelligence where:
- Open models match or exceed closed alternatives
- Anyone can run powerful AI on their own hardware
- The community drives innovation, not corporations
- AI capabilities are owned by users, not rented

<Aside type="caution">
This is an ambitious goal without a guaranteed path. We're betting on the open-source community,
improved hardware, and better techniques - but we're honest that this is a journey, not a
destination we've reached.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from just using ChatGPT?</strong></summary>

With Jan:
- Your conversations stay on your device
- No monthly subscription for local use
- Choose from many models, not just one
- Connect to tools ChatGPT doesn't support
- Own your AI infrastructure forever
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What can Jan actually do today?</strong></summary>

Right now, Jan can:
- Run models like Llama, Mistral, and our own Jan models locally
- Connect to cloud providers if you want more power
- Use MCP tools to create designs, analyze data, browse the web, and more
- Work completely offline once models are downloaded
- Provide an OpenAI-compatible API for developers
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How realistic is "open superintelligence"?</strong></summary>

Honestly? It's ambitious and uncertain. We believe the combination of:
- Rapidly improving open models
- Better consumer hardware
- Community innovation
- Specialized models working together

...can eventually rival closed platforms. But this is a multi-year journey with no guarantees. What we can guarantee is that we'll keep building in the open, with the community, towards this goal.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does Jan make money?</strong></summary>

- **Local use**: Always free
- **Cloud services**: Optional paid features (coming late 2025)
- **Enterprise**: Support and deployment services

We build sustainable software, not surveillance capitalism.

**Jan's Goal is**

> to build a superintelligence that you can self-host and use locally on your own devices.

**We know it's hard**

> but we believe this will be possible in the next decade.



Jan is moving from a local AI application to a complete full-stack AI solution that you can self-host. This includes models, applications, and tools that delight users and help them solve their problems.

## What We're Building

**Jan Factory (or Agent)** = Jan Models + Jan Application + Jan Tools

Unlike other AI assistants that do specific tasks with one model or have many models with a myriad of solutions, Jan provides:
- Its own specialised models that are optimised at specific tasks like web-search, creative writing, and translation
- Applications that work across all of your devices in an integrated way
- Tools to help you get things done

## Two Modes

### Local Mode
Run AI models entirely on your device, giving you complete privacy with no internet required.

### Cloud Mode
Connect to more powerful models when needed - either self-hosted or via jan.ai.

<Aside type="note">
Users shouldn't need to understand models, APIs, or technical details. Just choose Local for privacy or Cloud for power.

## Our Product Principles

### 1) It Just Works
1. Open Jan, start chatting
2. Onboarding is fully available but optional
3. Setting up an API key is optional
4. Selecting a local model is optional
5. Become a power user at your own pace, if you want to

We handle the complexity.

### 2) Cloud When Needed
Start completely locally and own your AI models. Add cloud capabilities only when you choose to.

### 3) Solve Problems, Not Settings
We help users get to answers quickly and leave the configurations as optional. Power users can dig deeper, but it's never required.

## Available on Every Device

We're building AI that respects your choices. Run it locally and power other apps, connect to the cloud for power, or self-host for both.

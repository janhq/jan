Jan is moving from a local AI application to a complete full-stack AI solution that you can self-host. This includes models, applications, and tools that delights users and help them solve their problems.

## What We're Building

**Jan Factory (or Agent)** = Jan Models + Jan Application + Jan Tools

Unlike other AI assistants that do specific tasks with one model or have many models with a myriad of solutions, Jan provides:
- Its own specialised models that are optimised at specific tasks like web-search, creative writing, and translation
- Applications that work across all of your devices in an integrated way
- Tools that actually get things done

## Two Modes, One Experience

### Local (Incognito) Mode

Run AI models entirely on your device, giving you complete privacy with no internet required.

### Cloud Mode

Connect to more powerful models when needed - either self-hosted or via jan.ai.

<Aside type="tip" title="Simple Choice">
Users shouldn't need to understand models, APIs, or technical details. Just choose Local for privacy or Cloud for power.
</Aside>

## Our Product Principles

### 1) It Just Works

1. Open Jan, start chatting
2. Onboarding is fully available but optional
3. Setting up an API key is optional
4. Selecting a local model is optional
5. Become a power user at your own pace, if you want to

We handle the complexity.

### 2) Cloud When Needed

Start completely locally and own your AI models. Add cloud capabilities only when you choose to.

### 3) Solve Problems, Not Settings

We help users get to answers quickly answers, not configuration options. Power users can dig deeper, but it's never required.

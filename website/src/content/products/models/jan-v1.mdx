## Our Foundational Model Family

Jan V1 is our in-house family of models designed to compete directly with leading models like GPT-4 and Claude. We're not just fine-tuning; we're building powerful, general-purpose models from the ground up to solve real-world problems with a focus on efficiency and privacy.

**Jan V1 models are currently in the pre-training phase.** They are not yet available for download or use. The information on this page reflects our development goals and roadmap.

### The Vision

Most AI applications today are simply wrappers around a few proprietary models. We believe in providing a powerful, open alternative that you can run on your own terms. Jan V1 is our commitment to that vision.

### Planned Model Lineup

| Model       | Target Size | Intended Use Case            | Availability  |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| Jan V1-7B   | 4-8GB       | Fast, efficient daily tasks  | Coming Soon   |
| Jan V1-13B  | 8-16GB      | Balanced power and performance | Coming Soon   |
| Jan V1-70B  | 40-64GB     | Deep analysis, professional work | Coming Soon   |
| Jan V1-180B | 100GB+      | Frontier research, complex tasks | Planned 2026 |

### What to Expect
- **Competitive Performance**: Aiming for results on par with leading closed-source models.
- **Optimized for Local Use**: Efficient quantized versions for running on your own hardware.
- **Privacy-Centric**: Trainable and runnable in your own environment, ensuring your data stays yours.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work perfectly within the Jan ecosystem, from Desktop to Server.

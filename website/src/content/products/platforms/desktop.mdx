This is how Jan started and it has been available since day 1.

Jan Desktop strives to be:

> Your personal AI workstation that helps with your use cases and powers other devices. Run models locally right away or bring an API key to connect to your favorite cloud-based models.

Jan Desktop is where it all starts. Download it, open it, and start chatting. Your AI runs on your computer with zero setup required.

## Two Modes, Zero Complexity

### Local Mode (Default)
Your conversations stay on your computer. No internet needed. Complete privacy.

### Cloud Mode
Connect to more powerful models when you need them. Your choice of provider.

<Aside type="note">
    As of today, when you first open Jan you do have to download a model or connect to a cloud provider, but that is about to change soon.

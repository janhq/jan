## Your Personal Research Analyst

`DeepResearch` is a planned native tool for Jan that transforms it into a powerful research agent. Give it a complex question, and it will autonomously browse, analyze, and synthesize information from numerous sources to deliver a comprehensive, structured report.

Think of it as Jan's answer to the advanced research capabilities seen in [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) and [Google's Gemini](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/), but built with privacy and user control at its core.

<Aside type="note">
**This tool is not yet available.** We are building `DeepResearch` to handle complex queries that would normally take a human hours of work.

### How It Will Work

Unlike a simple web search that returns a list of links, `DeepResearch` will understand your goal, create a research plan, execute it, and deliver a final, synthesized document with citations.

### Planned Core Features:
- **Autonomous Multi-Step Research**: Deconstructs complex questions into logical steps and executes them.
- **Comprehensive Source Analysis**: Can read and synthesize information from web pages, PDFs, and other documents.
- **Structured Report Generation**: Delivers well-organized reports, not just chat messages.
- **Full Transparency**: Cites all sources and shows its work, so you can verify the information.
- **Local-First Privacy**: Conduct research using local models to ensure your queries and findings remain private.

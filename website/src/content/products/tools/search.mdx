## Answers, Not Just Links

`Search` is a planned native tool for Jan that rethinks web search. Instead of just giving you a list of links to sift through, it understands your question, scours the web, and provides a direct, synthesized answer with sources cited.

Think of it as a private, self-hosted alternative to services like Perplexity.ai, integrated directly into your AI assistant.

**This tool is not yet available.** We are building `Search` to be the default way Jan accesses real-time information from the web.

### How It's Different
- **Privacy-First**: Your search queries are processed locally and anonymized. What you search for is your business.
- **Direct Answers**: Get a concise, accurate answer compiled from the best sources, not just ten blue links.
- **Cited Sources**: Every piece of information is backed by a verifiable source, so you can trust the answer or dig deeper.
- **Conversational Follow-up**: Ask follow-up questions in a natural way, and Jan will maintain context.

### Planned Core Features:
- **Real-Time Information**: Access up-to-the-minute news, data, and events.
- **Source Verification**: Prioritizes authoritative and reliable sources.
- **Customizable Focus**: Tailor your search to specific domains like academic papers, news, or code repositories.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works hand-in-hand with other tools like `DeepResearch` and `BrowserUse` for more complex tasks.

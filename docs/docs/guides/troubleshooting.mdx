## Broken Build

To resolve the issue where your Jan is stuck in a broken build after installation.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac" default>
        #### 1. Uninstall Jan

        Delete Jan from your `/Applications` folder.

        #### 2. Delete Application Data, Cache, and User Data

        ```zsh
        # Step 1: Delete the application data
        ## Newer versions
        rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan
        ## Versions 0.2.0 and older
        rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan-electron

        # Step 2: Clear application cache
        rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/jan*

        # Step 3: Remove all user data
        rm -rf ~/jan
        ```

        #### 3. Additional Step for Versions Before 0.4.2

        If you are using a version before `0.4.2`, you need to run the following commands:

        ```zsh
        ps aux | grep nitro
        # Looks for processes like `nitro` and `nitro_arm_64`, and kill them one by one by process ID
        kill -9 <PID>
        ```

        #### 4. Download the Latest Version

        Download the latest version of Jan from our [homepage](https://jan.ai/).

## Troubleshooting NVIDIA GPU

To resolve issues when the Jan app does not utilize the NVIDIA GPU on Windows and Linux systems.

#### 1. Ensure GPU Mode Requirements

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    
    ##### NVIDIA Driver

    - Install an [NVIDIA Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) supporting CUDA 11.7 or higher.
      - Use the following command to verify the installation:

    ```sh
    nvidia-smi
    ```

    ##### CUDA Toolkit

    - Install a [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) compatible with your NVIDIA driver.
      - Use the following command to verify the installation:

    ```sh
    nvcc --version
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    
    ##### NVIDIA Driver

    - Install an [NVIDIA Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) supporting CUDA 11.7 or higher.
      - Use the following command to verify the installation:

    ```sh
    nvidia-smi
    ```

    ##### CUDA Toolkit

    - Install a [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) compatible with your NVIDIA driver.
      - Use the following command to verify the installation:

    ```sh
    nvcc --version
    ```
    ##### Linux Specifics

    - Ensure that `gcc-11`, `g++-11`, `cpp-11`, or higher is installed.
      - See [instructions](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17) for Ubuntu installation.

    - **Post-Installation Actions**: Add CUDA libraries to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
    - Follow the [Post-installation Actions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions) instructions.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 2. Switch to GPU Mode

Jan defaults to CPU mode but automatically switches to GPU mode if your system supports it, selecting the GPU with the highest VRAM. Check this setting in `Settings` > `Advanced Settings`.

##### Troubleshooting Tips

If GPU mode isn't enabled by default:

1. Confirm that you have installed an NVIDIA driver supporting CUDA 11.7 or higher. Refer to [CUDA compatibility](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html#binary-compatibility__table-toolkit-driver).
2. Ensure compatibility of the CUDA toolkit with your NVIDIA driver. Refer to [CUDA compatibility](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html#binary-compatibility__table-toolkit-driver).
3. For Linux, add CUDA's `.so` libraries to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. For Windows, ensure that CUDA's `.dll` libraries are in the PATH. Refer to [Windows setup](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#environment-setup).

#### 3. Check GPU Settings

1. Navigate to `Settings` > `Advanced Settings` > `Jan Data Folder` to access GPU settings.
2. Open the `settings.json` file in the `settings` folder. Here's an example:

```json title="~/jan/settings/settings.json"
{
  "notify": true,
  "run_mode": "gpu",
  "nvidia_driver": {
    "exist": true,
    "version": "531.18"
  },
  "cuda": {
    "exist": true,
    "version": "12"
  },
  "gpus": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "vram": "12282"
    },
    {
      "id": "1",
      "vram": "6144"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "vram": "6144"
    }
  ],
  "gpu_highest_vram": "0"
}
```

#### 4. Restart Jan

Restart Jan application to make sure it works.

##### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure `nvidia_driver` and `cuda` fields indicate installed software.
- If `gpus` field is empty or lacks your GPU, check NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit installations.
- For further assistance, share the `settings.json` file.

## Something's Amiss

When you start a chat with a model and encounter with a Something's Amiss error, here's how to resolve it:

1. Ensure your OS is up to date.
2. Choose a model smaller than 80% of your hardware's V/RAM. For example, on an 8GB machine, opt for models smaller than 6GB.
3. Install the latest [Nightly release](/guides/quickstart/#nightly-releases) or [clear the application cache](/troubleshooting/#broken-build) when reinstalling Jan.
4. Confirm your V/RAM accessibility, particularly if using virtual RAM.
5. Nvidia GPU users should download [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
6. Linux users, ensure your system meets the requirements of gcc 11, g++ 11, cpp 11, or higher. Refer to this [link](/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-nvidia-gpu) for details.
7. You might use the wrong port when you [check the app logs](/troubleshooting/#how-to-get-error-logs) and encounter the Bind address failed at 127.0.0.1:3928 error. To check the port status, try use the `netstat` command, like the following:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS" default>
        ```sh
        netstat -an | grep 3928
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
        ```sh
        netstat -ano | find "3928" 
        tasklist /fi "PID eq 3928"
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
        ```sh
        netstat -anpe | grep "3928" 
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

`Netstat` displays the contents of various network-related data structures for active connections

:::

:::tip

Jan uses the following ports:

- Nitro: `3928`
- Jan API Server: `1337`
- Jan Documentation: `3001`

## Undefined Issue

Encountering an `undefined issue` in Jan is caused by errors related to the Nitro tool or other internal processes. It can be resolved through the following steps:

1. Clearing the Jan folder and then reopen the application to determine if the problem persists
2. Manually run the nitro tool located at `~/jan/extensions/@janhq/inference-nitro-extensions/dist/bin/(your-os)/nitro` to check for error messages.
3. Address any nitro error messages that are identified and reassess the persistence of the issue.
4. Reopen Jan to determine if the problem has been resolved after addressing any identified errors.
5. If the issue persists, please share the [app logs](/troubleshooting/#how-to-get-error-logs) via [Jan Discord](https://discord.gg/mY69SZaMaC) for further assistance and troubleshooting.

## Unexpected Token

Encountering the `Unexpected token` error when initiating a chat with OpenAI models mainly caused by either your OpenAI key or where you access your OpenAI from. This issue can be solved through the following steps:

1. Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/) and integrate it into your application.

2. Trying a VPN could potentially solve the issue, especially if it's related to region locking for accessing OpenAI services. By connecting through a VPN, you may bypass such restrictions and successfully initiate chats with OpenAI models.

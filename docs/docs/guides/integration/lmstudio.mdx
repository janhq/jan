## How to Integrate LM Studio with Jan

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) enables you to explore, download, and run local Large Language Models (LLMs). You can integrate Jan with LM Studio using two methods:
1. Integrate the LM Studio server with Jan UI
2. Migrate your downloaded model from LM Studio to Jan.

To integrate LM Studio with Jan follow the steps below:

:::note

In this guide, we're going to show you how to connect Jan to [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) using the second method. We'll use the [Phi 2 - GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF) model from Hugging Face as our example.
:::
### Step 1: Server Setup

1. Access the `Local Inference Server` within LM Studio.
2. Select your desired model.
3. Start the server after configuring the port and options.

4. Update the `openai.json` file in `~/jan/engines` to include the LM Studio server's full URL.

```json title="~/jan/engines/openai.json"
{
  "full_url": "http://localhost:<port>/v1/chat/completions"
}
```

:::tip

Replace `(port)` with your chosen port number. The default is 1234.

:::

### Step 2: Model Configuration

1. Navigate to `~/jan/models`.
2. Create a folder named `lmstudio-(modelname)`, like `lmstudio-phi-2`.
3. Inside, create a `model.json` file with these options:
   - Set `format` to `api`.
   - Specify `engine` as `openai`.
   - Set `state` to `ready`.
  
```json title="~/jan/models/lmstudio-phi-2/model.json"
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "phi-2-GGUF",
      "url": "https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF"
    }
  ],
  "id": "lmstudio-phi-2",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "LM Studio - Phi 2 - GGUF",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "author": "Microsoft",
    "tags": ["General", "Big Context Length"]
  },
  "engine": "openai"
}
```
:::note
For more details regarding the `model.json` settings and parameters fields,  please see [here](../models/integrate-remote.mdx#modeljson).

### Step 3: Starting the Model

1. Restart Jan and proceed to the **Hub**.
2. Locate your model and click **Use** to activate it.

## Migrating Models from LM Studio to Jan (version 0.4.6 and older)

### Step 1: Model Migration

1. In LM Studio, navigate to `My Models` and access your model folder.
2. Copy the model folder to `~/jan/models`.
3. Ensure the folder name matches the model name in the `.gguf` filename. Rename as necessary.

### Step 2: Activating the Model

1. Restart Jan and navigate to the **Hub**, where the model will be automatically detected.
2. Click **Use** to use the model.

## Direct Access to LM Studio Models from Jan (version 0.4.7+)

Starting from version 0.4.7, Jan enables direct import of LM Studio models using absolute file paths.


### Step 1: Locating the Model Path

1. Access `My Models` in LM Studio and locate your model folder.
2. Obtain the absolute path of your model.

### Step 2: Model Configuration

1. Go to `~/jan/models`.
2. Create a folder named `(modelname)` (e.g., `phi-2.Q4_K_S`).
3. Inside, craft a `model.json` file:
   - Set `id` to match the folder name.
   - Use the direct binary download link ending in `.gguf` as the `url`. You can now use the absolute filepath of the model file.
   - Set `engine` as `nitro`.

```json
{
  "object": "model",
  "version": 1,
  "format": "gguf",
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "phi-2.Q4_K_S.gguf",
      "url": "<absolute-path-of-model-file>"
    }

    "embedding": false,
    "prompt_template": "{system_message}\n### Instruction: {prompt}\n### Response:",

  },

    "size": 1615568736,
    "author": "User",
    "tags": []
  },
  "engine": "nitro"
}
```

:::warning

For Windows users, ensure to include double backslashes in the URL property, such as `C:\\Users\\username\\filename.gguf`.

### Step 3: Starting the Model

1. Restart Jan and proceed to the **Hub**.
2. Locate your model and click **Use** to activate it.

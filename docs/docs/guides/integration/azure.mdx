## How to Integrate Azure OpenAI with Jan

The [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview?source=docs) offers robust APIs, making it simple for you to incorporate OpenAI's language models into your applications. You can integrate Azure OpenAI with Jan by following the steps below:

### Step 1: Configure Azure OpenAI Service API Key

1. Set up and deploy the Azure OpenAI Service.
2. Once you've set up and deployed Azure OpenAI Service, you can find the endpoint and API key in [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/) under `Chat` > `View code`.

3. Set up the endpoint and API key for Azure OpenAI Service in the `~/jan/engines/openai.json` file.

```json title="~/jan/engines/openai.json"
{
  // https://hieujan.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-35-hieu-jan/chat/completions?api-version=2023-07-01-preview
  "full_url": "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<your-deployment-name>/chat/completions?api-version=<api-version>",
  "api_key": "<your-api-key>"
}
```

### Step 2: Model Configuration

1. Go to the `~/jan/models` directory. 
2. Make a new folder called `(your-deployment-name)`, for example `gpt-35-hieu-jan`.
3. Create a `model.json` file inside the folder with the specified configurations:
  - Match the `id` property with both the folder name and your deployment name.
  - Set the `format` property as `api`.
  - Choose `openai` for the `engine` property.
  - Set the `state` property as `ready`.

```json title="~/jan/models/gpt-35-hieu-jan/model.json"
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "azure_openai",
      "url": "https://hieujan.openai.azure.com"
    }
  ],
  "id": "gpt-35-hieu-jan",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "Azure OpenAI GPT 3.5",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Azure Open AI GPT 3.5 model is extremely good",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "author": "OpenAI",

  "engine": "openai"
}
```

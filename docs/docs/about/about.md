### Solution

Jan is a seamless user experience that runs on your personal computer, that glues the different pieces of the open source AI ecosystem to provide an alternative to OpenAI's closed platform. 

- We build a comprehensive, seamless platform that takes care of the technical chores across the stack required to run open source AI
- We run on top of a local folder of non-proprietary files, that anyone can tinker with (yes, even other apps!) 
- We provide open formats for packaging and distributing AI to run reproducibly across devices

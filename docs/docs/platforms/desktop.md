### Designed for Everyone

- **Installs with 1 click.** Jan is easy to use, beautiful, and the core features are free forever.
- **Runs on consumer laptops.** Tested by 250k+ users across `Windows, Mac, and Linux`, Jan even works on `CPU-only mode`.
- **Automatic GPU acceleration**. Models responds faster across `NVIDIA, AMD, Apple, and Intel` when benchmarked against industry alternatives.

“Normies” can run LLMs like an AI engineer on the Desktop App - no programming experience needed.

### Private & Offline

- **Runs 100% locally**. AI models run directly on your laptop without an internet connection. `You own your AI`.
- **Private conversations.** Data is saved on your own filesystem in a transparent non-proprietary data format. `You own your data.`
- **Open source security**. Jan is open source, so you can scruntinize every line in our codebase. So when we say your data is not our product, we mean it. See [the code](https://github.com/janhq/jan) and our [data policy](/how-we-work/analytics).

### Customizable AI

- **Use AI without limitations.** Take control of censorship levels. Jan is usable from the classroom to the boardroom (and few other rooms if that’s your jam).
- **Use any models**. Download open source models from HuggingFace or upload your own custom models. [link]

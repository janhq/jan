</div>

### Step 2: Install the requirement libraries

After cloning the repository, run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Create a copy of `.env.example`, named `.env`, and set it up

| Setting | Instructions |
| ------- | ------------ |
| DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN | Generate a new Discord application at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications), obtain a token from the Bot tab, and enable MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT. |
| LLM | For [Jan](https://jan.ai/), set to `local/openai/(MODEL_NAME)`, where `(MODEL_NAME)` is your loaded model's name. |
| CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT | Adjust the bot's behavior as needed. |
| CUSTOM_DISCORD_STATUS | Set a custom message for the bot's Discord profile. (Max 128 characters) | 
| ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS | Enter Discord channel IDs where the bot can send messages, separated by commas. Leave blank to allow all channels. |
| ALLOWED_ROLE_IDS | Enter Discord role IDs allowed to use the bot, separated by commas. Leave blank to allow everyone. Including at least one role also disables DMs. |
| MAX_IMAGES | Max number of image attachments allowed per message when using a vision model. (Default: `5`) |
| MAX_MESSAGES | Max messages allowed in a reply chain. (Default: `20`) |
| LOCAL_SERVER_URL | URL of your local API server for LLMs starting with `local/`. (Default: `http://localhost:5000/v1`) |
| LOCAL_API_KEY | API key for your local API server with LLMs starting with `local/`. Usually safe to leave blank. |

### Step 4: Invite the bot to your Discord server using this URL (replace `CLIENT_ID` with your Discord application's client ID from the OAuth2 tab)

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=(CLIENT_ID)&permissions=412317273088&scope=bot
```

### STep 5: Run the bot

Run the bot by using the following command in your command prompt:

```sh
python llmcord.py
```

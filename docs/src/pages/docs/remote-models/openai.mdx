## How to Integrate OpenAI API with Jan
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating the OpenAI API with Jan, allowing users to utilize OpenAI's capabilities within Jan's conversational interface.

## Integration Steps
<Steps>
### Step 1: Configure OpenAI API Key
1. Obtain OpenAI API Key from your [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) dashboard.
2. Copy your **OpenAI API Key**.
3. There are three ways to configure your API Key in Jan app:
  - Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Gear Icon (⚙️)** > **My Models** tab > **Add Icon (➕)** next to **OpenAI**.
  - Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Thread** > **Model** tab > **Add Icon (➕)** next to **OpenAI**.
  - Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Gear Icon (⚙️)** > **OpenAI** section under Model Providers.
4. Insert your **OpenAI API Key**.

### Step 2: Start Chatting with the Model

1. Select the OpenAI model you want to use.

<Callout type='info'>
The OpenAI is the default extension for the Jan application. All the OpenAI models are automatically installed when you install the Jan application.
</Callout>

2. Specify the model's parameters.
3. Start the conversation with the OpenAI model.
</Steps>

### OpenAI Models

You can also use specific OpenAI models you cannot find in the **Hub** section by customizing the `model.yaml` file, which you can see in the `~/jan/data/models/`. Follow the steps in the [Manage Models](/docs/models/manage-models) to manually add a model.

<Callout type='info'>
- You can find the list of available models in the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).
- The `id` property must match the model name in the list.
  - For example, if you want to use the [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo), you must set the `id` property to `gpt-4-1106-preview`.

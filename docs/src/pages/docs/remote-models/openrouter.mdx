# OpenRouter

## Integrate OpenRouter with Jan

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs#quick-start) is a tool that gathers AI models. Developers can utilize its API to engage with diverse large language models, generative image models, and generative 3D object models.

To connect Jan with OpenRouter for accessing remote Large Language Models (LLMs) through OpenRouter, you can follow the steps below:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Configure OpenRouter API Key

1. Find your API Key in the [OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
2. Copy your **OpenRouter API Key**.
3. There are three ways to configure your API Key in Jan app:
  - Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Gear Icon (⚙️)** > **My Models** tab > **Add Icon (➕)** next to **OpenRouter**.
  - Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Thread** > **Model** tab > **Add Icon (➕)** next to **OpenRouter**.
  - Navigate to the **Jan app** > **Gear Icon (⚙️)** > **OpenRouter** section under Model Providers.
4. Insert your **OpenRouter API Key**.
5. For **OpenRouter**, specify the model you want to use, or the system will default to the preset model linked to your **OpenRouter API Key**.

### Step 2: Start Chatting with the Model

1. Select the OpenRouter model you want to use.
2. Specify the model's parameters.
3. Start the conversation with the OpenRouter model.
</Steps>

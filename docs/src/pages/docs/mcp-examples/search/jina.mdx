# Jina MCP

Jina AI provides powerful web search and content extraction APIs, but doesn't offer an official MCP server. The community has built two MCP implementations that bring Jina's capabilities to Jan.

These community servers enable AI models to search the web, extract content from web pages, and perform fact-checking using Jina's infrastructure.

<Callout type="warning">
These are community-maintained packages, not official Jina AI releases. Exercise standard caution when installing third-party packages and verify their source code before use.
</Callout>

## Available Servers

### PsychArch/jina-mcp-tools
Basic implementation with core functionality:
- `jina_reader`: Extract content from web pages
- `jina_search`: Search the web

### JoeBuildsStuff/mcp-jina-ai  
More comprehensive implementation with additional features:
- `read_webpage`: Advanced content extraction with multiple formats
- `search_web`: Web search with configurable options
- `fact_check`: Fact-checking and grounding capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Jan with MCP enabled
- Jina AI API key from [jina.ai](https://jina.ai/?sui=apikey) (optional for basic features)
- Model with tool calling support
- Node.js installed

<Callout type="info">
Some features work without an API key, but registration provides enhanced capabilities and higher rate limits.
</Callout>

## Setup

### Enable MCP

1. Go to **Settings** > **MCP Servers**
2. Toggle **Allow All MCP Tool Permission** ON

### Model Configuration

Use a tool-enabled model:

- **Anthropic Claude 3.5+ Sonnet**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**
- **Google Gemini Pro**

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing model selection with tools enabled]

## Usage

Start a new chat with your tool-enabled model. Jina tools will appear in the available tools list.

### Web Content Extraction

**Basic Server:**
```
Extract the main content from https://example.com/article
```

**Advanced Server:**
```
Read the webpage at https://news.example.com and format it as clean markdown
```

The advanced server offers multiple extraction modes:
- **Standard**: Balanced speed and quality
- **Comprehensive**: Maximum data extraction
- **Clean Content**: Remove ads and navigation

### Web Search

**Basic Server:**
```
Search for "latest developments in quantum computing" and return 5 results
```

**Advanced Server:**
```
Search for machine learning tutorials, limit to 10 results from github.com
```

The advanced server supports:
- Configurable result counts
- Site-specific filtering
- Multiple output formats

### Fact Checking (Advanced Only)

```
Fact-check this statement: "The Great Wall of China is visible from space"
```

Returns:
- Factuality scores
- Supporting evidence
- Reference sources
- Contradictory information

### GitHub Integration

Both servers handle GitHub URLs intelligently:

```
Extract the code from https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/script.js
```

GitHub file URLs are automatically converted to raw content for direct access.

## Advanced Features

### Content Formats (Advanced Server)

- **Default**: Jina's native markdown format
- **Markdown**: Structured with headers and links
- **Text**: Plain text only
- **HTML**: Raw HTML content
- **Screenshot**: Visual page capture

### Search Options

- **Result Count**: Configure number of search results
- **Site Filtering**: Limit searches to specific domains
- **Image Retention**: Include or exclude image content
- **Alt Text Generation**: AI-generated image descriptions

### Fact-Checking Modes

- **Standard**: Quick factuality assessment
- **Deep Dive**: Comprehensive analysis with multiple sources
- **Evidence Scoring**: Quantified support/contradiction metrics

## Use Cases

### Research and Analysis
Extract content from academic papers, news articles, and research websites for comprehensive analysis.

### Content Verification
Fact-check claims and statements using multiple web sources and credibility scoring.

### Code Documentation
Extract and analyze code from GitHub repositories and technical documentation sites.

### Market Research
Search for industry information, competitor analysis, and market trends across specific domains.

### News Monitoring
Track breaking news, extract article content, and verify information across multiple sources.

### Academic Writing
Gather sources, extract citations, and verify facts for research papers and articles.

## Security Considerations

**Third-Party Packages:**
- These are community-maintained, not official Jina AI packages
- Review source code on GitHub before installation
- Monitor package updates and community feedback
- Consider package reputation and maintenance activity

**API Key Security:**
- Store API keys securely in environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity
- Rotate keys periodically

**Content Filtering:**
- Be aware that extracted content reflects source material
- Implement additional filtering for sensitive applications
- Consider content validation for critical use cases

## Troubleshooting

**Installation Issues:**
- Verify Node.js installation and version
- Check npm/npx permissions and configuration
- Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

**Server Connection Problems:**
- Confirm MCP server shows as active
- Check API key format and validity
- Restart Jan after configuration changes
- Verify network connectivity to Jina APIs

**Content Extraction Failures:**
- Some websites block automated access
- Try different extraction modes (advanced server)
- Check if target site requires authentication
- Verify URL accessibility in browser

**Rate Limiting:**
- Jina AI has rate limits for free accounts
- Consider upgrading API plan for higher limits
- Implement delays between requests
- Monitor usage through Jina dashboard

**Tool Calling Issues:**
- Ensure model supports tool calling
- Check that Jina tools appear in tools panel
- Try Claude 3.5+ Sonnet or GPT-4o for best results
- Verify MCP permissions are enabled

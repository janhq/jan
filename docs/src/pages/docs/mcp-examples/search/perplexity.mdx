# Perplexity MCP

[Perplexity MCP](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/mcp-server) brings real-time web search directly into Jan through Perplexity's Sonar API. This official implementation lets AI models perform live web searches and return current, relevant information without the knowledge cutoff limitations of base models.

Unlike static training data, this integration provides access to current web information, making it useful for research, fact-checking, and staying current with recent developments.

### Basic Web Search

```
What are the latest developments in quantum computing this week?
```

The AI will:
1. Query Perplexity's search engine
2. Return current, relevant information
3. Include source links and references
4. Provide up-to-date context

### Research Queries

```
Compare the current market leaders in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and their recent partnerships.
```

This produces:
- Current market analysis
- Recent partnership announcements
- Competitive landscape overview
- Source attribution for claims

### Real-Time Information

```
What's happening with the latest SpaceX launch? Any delays or updates?
```

Results include:
- Current launch status
- Recent updates or changes
- Official announcements
- News coverage links

### Multi-Turn Research

```
Search for information about the new EU AI Act. Then tell me how it specifically affects small startups.
```

Enables:
- Initial broad research
- Follow-up targeted queries
- Contextual understanding
- Comprehensive analysis

## Advanced Features

### Conversational Research

The `perplexity_ask` tool accepts conversation messages, enabling:
- Multi-turn research sessions
- Context-aware follow-up queries
- Refined search based on previous results
- Deeper exploration of topics

### Source Attribution

All results include:
- Reference links to original sources
- Publication dates when available
- Authority indicators
- Fact-checking context

- **Include timeframes**: "AI regulation changes this month"
- **Specify sources**: "Recent academic papers on climate change"
- **Ask follow-ups**: Build on previous searches for deeper insights

### Research Strategies
- Start broad, then narrow focus based on initial results
- Use follow-up questions to explore specific aspects
- Cross-reference multiple sources for verification
- Request specific types of sources (academic, news, official)

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues:**
- Verify API key format and validity
- Check Perplexity account status and credits
- Confirm API key permissions in dashboard
- Test API key with direct API calls

**Server Connection Problems:**
- Ensure NPX can access npm registry
- Check Node.js installation and version
- Verify internet connectivity
- Restart Jan after configuration changes

**Search Quality Issues:**
- Refine query specificity and context
- Try different search approaches
- Check if topic has recent information available
- Verify sources are current and authoritative

**Tool Calling Problems:**
- Confirm model supports tool calling
- Check that Perplexity tools appear in tools panel
- Try Claude 3.5+ Sonnet for best results
- Verify MCP permissions are enabled

**Rate Limiting:**
- Monitor API usage in Perplexity dashboard
- Check account limits and quotas
- Consider upgrading account plan if needed
- Implement delays between searches if necessary

<Callout type="warning">
Perplexity API has usage limits based on your account plan. Monitor consumption to avoid service interruptions.
</Callout>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Search Parameters

The default implementation uses standard search parameters. For custom configurations:
- Search model selection
- Response length preferences
- Source filtering options
- Citation format preferences

Modifications require editing the server configuration directly.

### Docker Alternative

For containerized environments, Perplexity also provides Docker configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity-ask": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "mcp/perplexity-ask"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Canva MCP

[Canva MCP](https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/deep-research-integration-mcp-server/) brings professional design capabilities directly into Jan through natural language commands. As the first design platform to offer native MCP integration, Canva lets AI models create presentations, resize graphics, and edit templates without leaving the chat.

Instead of switching between apps to create designs, you describe what you need and the AI handles the design work using your Canva account and assets.

## Available Tools

The Canva MCP server provides comprehensive design automation:
- **Template Generation**: Create presentations, social media posts, and documents
- **Asset Management**: Import, export, and organize design assets  
- **Design Editing**: Resize graphics, modify layouts, and update content
- **Content Integration**: Use existing Canva assets and brand elements
- **Format Conversion**: Export designs in multiple formats (PDF, PNG, etc.)

## Prerequisites

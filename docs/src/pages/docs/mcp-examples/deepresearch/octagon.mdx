### Technical Debugging

```
Research the latest techniques for spotting memory leaks in large React + Node.js projects. Then build a command-line analyzer that scans a codebase and suggests fixes.
```

The research will:
1. Analyze current memory leak detection methods
2. Compare available tools and libraries
3. Identify best practices and patterns
4. Generate working code implementation
5. Provide optimization recommendations

### Framework Evaluation

```
Compare Next.js, Remix, and Astro for high-traffic e-commerce. Benchmark build speed, runtime performance, and SEO. Build a functional storefront with the winner.
```

This produces:
- Detailed performance comparisons
- Real-world benchmarking data
- SEO and accessibility analysis
- Working storefront implementation
- Deployment recommendations

### API Analysis

```
Evaluate leading video-streaming APIs on cost, latency, uptime, and documentation quality. Create a working demo with the top choice.
```

Results include:
- Comprehensive API comparison matrix
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Integration complexity assessment
- Working implementation demo
- Production deployment guide

### Package Discovery

```
Compare Python libraries for real-time chat systems. Build a runnable chat server with the best stack, including Docker setup.
```

Delivers:
- Library performance benchmarks
- Feature comparison analysis
- Security and maintenance evaluation
- Complete working implementation
- Production-ready configuration

## Advanced Research Capabilities

### Multi-Source Analysis

Octagon pulls from extensive technical sources:
- Official documentation and changelogs
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers
- Stack Overflow and developer forums
- Performance benchmarking sites
- Security vulnerability databases

### Cross-Verification

Research findings are cross-checked across multiple sources for accuracy and currency.

### Implementation Focus

Unlike generic research tools, Octagon prioritizes actionable results that lead directly to working code and implementations.

## Use Cases

### Development Teams

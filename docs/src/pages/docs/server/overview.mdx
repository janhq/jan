## Overview

Jan Server is a comprehensive self-hosted AI server platform that provides OpenAI-compatible APIs, multi-tenant organization management, and AI model inference capabilities. Jan Server enables organizations to deploy their own private AI infrastructure with full control over data, models, and access.

Jan Server is a Kubernetes-native platform consisting of multiple microservices that work together to provide a complete AI infrastructure solution. It offers:

- **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Full compatibility with OpenAI's chat completion API
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Organization and project-based access control
- **AI Model Inference**: Scalable model serving with health monitoring
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL with read/write replicas
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT + Google OAuth2 integration
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and management
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Support for external tools and resources
- **Web Search Integration**: Serper API integration for web search capabilities
- **Monitoring & Profiling**: Built-in performance monitoring and health checks

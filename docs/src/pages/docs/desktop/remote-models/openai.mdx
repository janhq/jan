# OpenAI

Jan supports most [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as well as the many OpenAI-compatible APIs out there,
allowing you to use all models from OpenAI (GPT-4o, o3 and even those from Together AI, DeepSeek, Fireworks
and more) through Jan's interface.

## Integrate OpenAI API with Jan

<Steps>

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Visit the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and sign in
2. Create & copy a new API key or copy your existing one

</Steps>

## Available OpenAI Models

Jan automatically includes popular OpenAI models. In case you want to use a specific model that you
cannot find in Jan, follow instructions in [Add Cloud Models](/docs/desktop/manage-models#add-models-1):
- See list of available models in [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).
- The id property must match the model name in the list. For example, if you want to use the
[GPT-4.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/), you must set the id property
to respective one.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. API Key Issues
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have billing set up on your OpenAI account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

2. Connection Problems
- Check your internet connection
- Verify OpenAI's [system status](https://status.openai.com)
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/desktop/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

3. Model Unavailable
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your OpenAI account has the necessary permissions

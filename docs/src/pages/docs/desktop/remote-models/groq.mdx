# Groq

Jan supports [Groq](https://groq.com/) API integration, allowing you to use Groq's high-performance LLM models (LLaMA 2, Mixtral and more) through Jan's interface.

## Integrate Groq API with Jan

<Steps>
### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys) and sign in
2. Create & copy a new API key or copy your existing one

<Callout type='info'>
Ensure your API key has sufficient credits
</Callout>

### Step 2: Configure Jan

1. Navigate to the **Settings** (<Settings width={16} height={16} style={{display:"inline"}}/>)
2. Under **Model Providers**, select **Groq**
3. Insert your **API Key**

<br/>


### Step 3: Start Using Groq's Models

1. Jump into any existing **Chat** or create a new one
2. Select a Groq model from **model selector**
3. Start chatting
</Steps>

## Available Models Through Groq

Jan automatically includes Groq's available models. In case you want to use a specific Groq model that
you cannot find in **Jan**, follow the instructions in the [Add Cloud Models](/docs/desktop/manage-models#add-models-1):
- See list of available models in [Groq Documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/models).
- The `id` property must match the model name in the list. For example, if you want to use Llama3.3 70B, you must set the `id` property to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have billing set up on your Groq account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Groq's system status
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/desktop/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your Groq account has the necessary permissions

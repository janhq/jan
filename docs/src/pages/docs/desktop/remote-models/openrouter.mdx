# OpenRouter

## Integrate OpenRouter with Jan

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a tool that gathers AI model APIs and provides access to all
via a unified API. Developers can use the API to interact with LLMs, generative image models, and
even models that generate 3D objects, all with a competitive pricing.

Jan supports the OpenRouter API, allowing you to use models from various providers (Anthropic, Google,
Meta and more) and helping you avoid having to get an API from all of your favorite ones.

OpenRouter even offers a few free models! 🙌

- Specify a model using the format: `organization/model-name`
- Available options can be found in [OpenRouter's Model Reference](https://openrouter.ai/models)

**Examples of Model IDs:**
- Claude 4 Opus: `anthropic/claude-opus-4`
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro: `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview`
- DeepSeek R1 Latest: `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528`

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have sufficient credits in your OpenRouter account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify OpenRouter's [system status](https://status.openrouter.ai)
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/desktop/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm the model is currently available on OpenRouter
- Check if you're using the correct model ID format
- Verify the model provider is currently operational

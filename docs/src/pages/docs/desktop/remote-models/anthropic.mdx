## Available Anthropic Models

Jan automatically includes Anthropic's available models. In case you want to use a specific Anthropic model
that you cannot find in **Jan**, follow instructions in [Add Cloud Models](/docs/desktop/manage-models#add-models-1):
- See list of available models in [Anthropic Models](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview).
- The `id` property must match the model name in the list. For example, `claude-opus-4@20250514`, `claude-sonnet-4@20250514`, or `claude-3-5-haiku@20241022`.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have billing set up on your Anthropic account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Anthropic's system status
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/desktop/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your Anthropic account has the necessary permissions

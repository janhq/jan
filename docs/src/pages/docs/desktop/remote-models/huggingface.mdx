# Hugging Face

Jan supports Hugging Face models through two methods: the new **HF Router** (recommended) and **Inference Endpoints**. Both methods require a Hugging Face token and **billing to be set up**.

## Option 1: HF Router (Recommended)

The HF Router provides access to models from multiple providers (Replicate, Together AI, SambaNova, Fireworks, Cohere, and more) through a single endpoint.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Get Your HF Token

Visit [Hugging Face Settings > Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a token. Make sure you have billing set up on your account.

### Step 2: Configure Jan

1. Go to **Settings** > **Model Providers** > **HuggingFace**
2. Enter your HF token
3. Use this URL: `https://router.huggingface.co/v1`

You can find out more about the HF Router [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/index).

### Step 3: Start Using Models

Jan comes with three HF Router models pre-configured. Select one and start chatting immediately.

</Steps>

<Callout type='info'>
The HF Router automatically routes your requests to the best available provider for each model, giving you access to a wide variety of models without managing individual endpoints.
</Callout>

## Option 2: HF Inference Endpoints

For more control over specific models and deployment configurations, you can use Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Navigate to the HuggingFace Model Hub

Visit the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (make sure you are logged in) and pick the model you want to use.

### Step 2: Configure HF Inference Endpoint and Deploy

After you have selected the model you want to use, click on the **Deploy** button and select a deployment method. We will select HF Inference Endpoints for this one.

![HuggingFace Deployment](../_assets/hf_jan_nano.png)
<br/>

This will take you to the deployment set up page. For this example, we will leave the default settings as they are under the GPU tab and click on **Create Endpoint**.

<br/>

Once your endpoint is ready, test that it works on the **Test your endpoint** tab.

![HuggingFace Deployment](../_assets/hf_jan_nano_3.png)
<br/>

If you get a response, you can click on **Copy** to copy the endpoint URL and API key.

<Callout type='info'>
  You will need to be logged into the HuggingFace Inference Endpoints and have a credit card on file to deploy a model.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Configure Jan

If you do not have an API key you can create one under **Settings** > **Access Tokens** [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Once you finish, copy the token and add it to Jan alongside your endpoint URL at **Settings** > **Model Providers** > **HuggingFace**.

**3.2 HF Endpoint URL**

**3.3 Jan Settings**

<Callout type='warning'>
Make sure to add `/v1/` to the end of your endpoint URL. This is required by the OpenAI API.
</Callout>

**3.4 Add Model Details**

### Step 4: Start Using the Model

Now you can start using the model in any chat.

## Available Hugging Face Models

**Option 1 (HF Router):** Access to models from multiple providers as shown in the providers image above.

**Option 2 (Inference Endpoints):** You can follow the steps above with a large amount of models on Hugging Face and bring them to Jan. Check out other models in the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. Started a chat but the model is not responding**
- Verify your API_KEY/HF_TOKEN is correct and not expired
- Ensure you have billing set up on your HF account
- For Inference Endpoints: Ensure the model you're trying to use is running again since, after a while, they go idle so that you don't get charged when you are not using it

![Model Running](../_assets/hf_jan_nano_9.png)

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Hugging Face's system status
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/desktop/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your Hugging Face account has the necessary permissions

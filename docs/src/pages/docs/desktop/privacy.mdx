# Privacy

Jan is your AI. Period. Here's what we do with data.

<Callout>
Full privacy policy lives [here](/docs/desktop/privacy-policy), if you're into that sort of thing.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Zero data collection until you say so. Scout's honor.
</Callout>

You'll choose tracking preferences at first launch. Change them anytime in Settings.

Jan will **never** peek at your chats, settings, or model choices. Not even if you ask nicely.

## Data We Track (With Permission)

We track basic app usage to improve Jan. That's it.

### Product Analytics

When allowed, we count:

- **Active Users**: Daily Jan-thusiasts
- **Retention**: Who sticks around

Everything's tied to a random ID - not you. Your chats stay yours.

## What We Don't Track

<Callout type="info">
Jan respects boundaries. We're committed to protecting your privacy.
</Callout>

- No chat snooping
- No file scanning
- No identity tracking
- No prompt logging
- No conversation monitoring
- No model tracking

Your private stuff stays private.

## Cloud Model Use

Cloud models (like GPT, Claude) need to see your messages to work. That's between you and them - Jan just makes
the introduction. Local models keep everything at home where the neighbors can't gossip.

## Data Storage
[PostHog EU](https://posthog.com/eu) handles our analytics. All EU-based, GDPR-compliant, properly buttoned
up. Details in their [GDPR docs](https://posthog.com/docs/privacy/gdpr-compliance).

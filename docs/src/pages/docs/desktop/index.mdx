# Overview  

<Callout type="info">
We're building [Open Superintelligence](https://jan.ai/handbook/open-superintelligence) together.
</Callout>

Jan is an open-source replacement for ChatGPT:
- AI Models: Use AI models with agentic capabilities
  - [Open-source Models](/docs/desktop/manage-models): Run open-source locally
  - [Cloud Models](/docs/desktop/remote-models/anthropic): Connect to remote models with API keys
- [Assistants](/docs/desktop/assistants): Create custom AI assistants
- [MCP Servers](/docs/desktop/mcp): Integrate MCP Servers to give agentic capabilities to AI models
- Jan Hub: Browse, install, and [manage models](/docs/desktop/manage-models)
- Local API Server: Expose an [OpenAI-compatible API](/docs/desktop/api-server) from your own machine or server

## Product Suite

Jan is a full [product suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_suite) that offers an alternative to Big AI:
- [Jan Desktop](/docs/desktop/quickstart): macOS, Windows, and Linux apps with offline mode
- [Jan Web](https://chat.jan.ai): Jan on browser, a direct alternative to chatgpt.com
- Jan Mobile: iOS and Android apps (Coming Soon)
- [Jan Server](/docs/server): deploy locally, in your cloud, or on-prem
- [Jan Models](/docs/models): Open-source models optimized for deep research, tool use, and reasoning 

### Extending Jan (Coming Soon)  
Jan helps you customize and align Open Superintelligence:
- Jan Connectors: Extend Jan with integrations
- Jan Studio: Fine-tune, align, and guardrail
- Evals: Benchmark models across industries, regions, and alignment dimensions  

## Principles  

- [Open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/open-source-culture-9-core-principles-and-values): [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) licensed, built in public.  
- No [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in): Switch freely between local and frontier models.  
- [Right to Repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair): Inspect, audit, and modify your AI stack.  

Jan grows through contribution. It is shaped by many and belongs to everyone who uses it.

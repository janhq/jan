# Serpex Search MCP

[Serpex](https://serpex.dev) provides unified access to multiple search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Yahoo, Yandex) through a single API, making it perfect for giving AI models access to real-time web information with automatic engine routing and structured JSON results.

## Available Tools

- `serpex_search`: Search across multiple engines with automatic routing and time filtering

## Prerequisites

- Jan with experimental features enabled
- Serpex API key from [serpex.dev](https://serpex.dev)
- Model with tool calling support (recommended: Jan v1)

<Callout type="info">
Serpex offers 200 free credits to get started, with requests starting at just $0.0008 each. The API handles retries, blocking and captchas automatically.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
Using `npx` means you don't need to install anything - it will automatically download and run the latest version of the Serpex MCP server from npm.
</Callout>

### Download Jan v1

Jan v1 is optimized for tool calling and works excellently with Serpex:

1. Go to the **Hub** tab
2. Search for **Jan v1**
3. Choose your preferred quantization
4. Click **Download**

## Usage

### Start a New Chat

With Jan v1 selected and Serpex configured, you'll see the Serpex search tool available.

### Example Queries

**Current Information:**
```
What are the latest developments in quantum computing this week?
```

**Multi-Engine Search:**
```
Search for "best AI models 2025" using different search engines and compare the results.
```

**Comparative Analysis:**
```
What are the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript? Give me current best practices.
```

**Research Tasks:**
```
Find recent news about SpaceX Starship launches.
```

**Time-Filtered Search:**
```
What are the top tech news stories from the last 24 hours?
```

**Local Information:**
```
Find coffee shops in San Francisco that opened this year.
```

## How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: Jan v1 analyzes your question and determines search parameters
2. **Engine Selection**: Serpex automatically routes to the best available engine (or uses your specified engine)
3. **Web Search**: Calls Serpex API which handles captchas, blocks, and retries automatically
4. **Result Parsing**: Returns clean, structured JSON with titles, URLs, snippets, and metadata
5. **Synthesis**: Jan v1 combines search results into a comprehensive, conversational answer

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific**: "Tesla Model 3 2024 price in California" works better than "Tesla price"
- **Use auto engine**: Let Serpex choose the best engine automatically with `engine: 'auto'`
- **Request recent info**: Use time_range parameter or add "latest", "recent" to queries
- **Ask follow-ups**: Jan v1 maintains context for deeper research
- **Combine with analysis**: Ask for comparisons, summaries, or insights from search results

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Verify `SERPEX_API_KEY` is set correctly in environment variables
- Check that Node.js is installed and accessible
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

### No Results Returned
- Check your API key is valid at [serpex.dev](https://serpex.dev)
- Verify you have available credits in your Serpex account
- Try with `engine: 'auto'` to let Serpex choose the best engine

### Tool Not Showing in Jan
- Ensure experimental features are enabled
- Verify MCP is enabled and permissions are granted
- Restart Jan after adding the MCP server
- Check that Jan v1 has tools enabled in model settings

<Callout type="warning">
Each search query consumes API credits. Monitor usage at serpex.dev dashboard.
</Callout>

## API Limits

Serpex offers flexible pricing:

- **Free Tier**: Generous limits for testing and personal use
- **Rate Limit**: 300 requests/second
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use, no subscription

Visit [serpex.dev/pricing](https://serpex.dev/pricing) for current pricing details.

## Next Steps

Serpex MCP enables Jan v1 to access current web information across multiple search engines, making it a powerful research assistant. Combine with other MCP tools for even more capabilities - use Serpex for search, then E2B for data analysis, or Jupyter for visualization.

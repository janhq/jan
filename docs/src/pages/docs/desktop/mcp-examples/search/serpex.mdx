## How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: Jan v1 analyzes your question and determines search parameters
2. **Engine Selection**: Serpex automatically routes to the best available engine (or uses your specified engine)
3. **Web Search**: Calls Serpex API which handles captchas, blocks, and retries automatically
4. **Result Parsing**: Returns clean, structured JSON with titles, URLs, snippets, and metadata
5. **Synthesis**: Jan v1 combines search results into a comprehensive, conversational answer

## Key Advantages of Serpex

- **Multi-Engine Support**: Access Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Yahoo, and Yandex through one API
- **Auto Routing**: Automatic engine selection based on availability and performance
- **Block-Free**: Handles captchas, rate limits, and blocking automatically
- **Fast & Affordable**: Optimized for speed and cost-effectiveness
- **Structured Data**: Clean JSON output perfect for AI processing
- **Time Filtering**: Filter results by recency (day, week, month, year)

## Search Parameters

The `serpex_search` tool supports these parameters:

- **q** (required): Your search query
- **engine** (optional): Choose from:
  - `auto` (default) - Automatically selects best engine
  - `google` - Google Search
  - `bing` - Microsoft Bing
  - `duckduckgo` - DuckDuckGo
  - `brave` - Brave Search
  - `yahoo` - Yahoo Search

  - `year` - Past year

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific**: "Tesla Model 3 2024 price in California" works better than "Tesla price"
- **Use auto engine**: Let Serpex choose the best engine automatically with `engine: 'auto'`
- **Request recent info**: Use time_range parameter or add "latest", "recent" to queries
- **Ask follow-ups**: Jan v1 maintains context for deeper research
- **Combine with analysis**: Ask for comparisons, summaries, or insights from search results

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

- Verify `SERPEX_API_KEY` is set correctly in environment variables
- Check that Node.js is installed and accessible
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

### No Results Returned

- Check your API key is valid at [serpex.dev](https://serpex.dev)
- Verify you have available credits in your Serpex account
- Try with `engine: 'auto'` to let Serpex choose the best engine
- Check the MCP server logs for error messages

### Tool Not Showing in Jan

- Ensure experimental features are enabled
- Verify MCP is enabled and permissions are granted
- Restart Jan after adding the MCP server
- Check that Jan v1 has tools enabled in model settings

### API Rate Limits

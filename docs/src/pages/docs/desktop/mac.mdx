## Metal Acceleration

Jan is specially designed to work well on Mac Silicon, using `llama.cpp` as its main engine for processing AI tasks efficiently. It **automatically uses [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal)**, Apple's latest technology that can be used for GPU acceleration, so you don’t need to turn on this feature manually.

<Callout type="info">
💡 Metal, used for GPU acceleration, is not supported on Intel-based Mac devices.

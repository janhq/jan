# Jan

![Jan's Cover Image](./_assets/jan-app.png)


Jan is an AI chat application that runs 100% offline on your desktop & mobile (*coming soon*). Our goal is to
make it easy for anyone, with or without coding skills, to download and use AI models with full control and
[privacy](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/privacy-paradox-with-ai-2023-10-31/).

Jan is powered by [Cortex](https://cortex.so/), our embeddable local AI engine which provides an OpenAI-compatible
API that can run in the background at `https://localhost:1337` (or a custom port). This enables you to power other
applications running locally with AI capabilities. For example, you can connect tools like [Continue.dev](https://jan.ai/integrations/coding/vscode)
and [Cline](https://cline.bot/), or any OpenAI-compatible app, to Jan and start coding on their supported editors using
models hosted in Jan.

Jan doesn't limit you to locally hosted models, meaning, you can create an API key from your favorite model provider
and add it to Jan via the configuration's page and start talking to your favorite paid models.

### Features

- Download popular open-source LLMs (Llama3, Gemma3, Mistral,and more) from the HugggingFace [Model Hub](./docs/models/manage-models.mdx)
or import any GGUF models available locally
- Connect to [cloud model services](/docs/remote-models/openai) (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq,...)
- [Chat](./docs/threads.mdx) with AI models & [customize their parameters](./docs/models/model-parameters.mdx) via our
intuitive interface
- Use our [local API server](https://jan.ai/api-reference) with an OpenAI-equivalent API
- Customize Jan with [extensions](/docs/extensions)

### Philosophy

Jan is built to be [user-owned](about#-user-owned), this means that Jan is:
- Truly open source via the [AGPLv3 license](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan/blob/dev/LICENSE)
- [Data is stored locally, following one of the many local-first principles](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first)
- Runs 100% offline, with privacy by default
- Free choice of AI models, both local and cloud-based
- We do not collect or sell user data. See our [Privacy](/privacy).

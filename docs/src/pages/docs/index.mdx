# Jan

![Jan's Cover Image](./_assets/jan-app.png)


Jan is a ChatGPT-alternative that runs 100% offline on your [Desktop](/docs/desktop-installation). Our goal is to make it easy for a layperson[^1] to download and run LLMs and use AI with full control and [privacy](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/privacy-paradox-with-ai-2023-10-31/).

Jan is powered by [Cortex](https://cortex.so/), our embeddable local AI engine. 

<Callout>
**OpenAI-equivalent API:** Jan runs a Cortex Server in the background, which provides an OpenAI-equivalent API at https://localhost:1337. 

You'll be able to use it with [Continue.dev](https://jan.ai/integrations/coding/vscode), [Open Interpreter](https://jan.ai/integrations/function-calling/interpreter), or any OpenAI-compatible app.

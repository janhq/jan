# Jan Data Folder
Jan stores your data locally in your own filesystem in a universal file format (JSON). We build for privacy by default and do not collect or sell your data.

This guide helps you understand where and how this data is stored.

## Open Jan Data Folder

To open from Jan's interface:
1. In Jan, navigate to **Settings** (<Settings width={16} height={16} style={{display:"inline"}}/>) > **Advanced Settings**
2. Click <FolderOpen width={16} height={16} style={{display:"inline"}}/> icon to open Jan Data Folder
<br/>

<br/>
To open through Terminal:

```bash
# Windows
%APPDATA%/Jan/data

# Mac
~/Library/Application Support/Jan/data

# Linux
## Custom installation directory
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Jan/data

or

## Default installation directory
~/.config/Jan/data

```

## Folder Structure
Jan app data folder should have the following folder structure:
<Callout type="info">
Jan is stored in the root `~/jan` by default.

### `jan/` (The Root Directory)

This is the primary directory where all files related to Jan are stored. It typically resides in the user's home directory.

### `assistants/`

Stores configuration files for various AI assistants. Each assistant within this directory can have different settings.

- **Default Assistant**: Located in `/assistants/jan/`, it includes an `assistant.json` configuring the default settings and capabilities. The default sample of `assistan.json` is as follows:

```json
{
  "avatar": "",
  "id": "jan",
  "object": "assistant",
  "created_at": 1715132389207,
  "name": "Jan",
  "description": "A default assistant that can use all downloaded models",
  "model": "*",
  "instructions": ""
}

```

Each parameter in the file is defined as follows:

| Parameter               | Description                                                                                   | Type    | Default Value                                      |

### `extensions/`

Extensions enhance Jan's functionality by adding new capabilities or integrating external services.

- **@janhq**: The root folder for all extensions by the author. Extensions with organization-level names (e.g., `@janhq/monitoring-extension`) are stored here. If there is no organization, the folder holds the extension directly (e.g., `example-extension`).

- **extensions.json**: A file that lists all installed extensions and their metadata, taken from each extension’s `package.json`. It helps avoid scanning all extension folders, improving performance.

### `logs/`

Logs from the application are stored here. This is useful for troubleshooting and monitoring the application's behavior over time. The file `/logs/app.txt` uses prefixes to indicate the source of the logs:
- **[APP]**: App logs
- **[SERVER]**: API server logs
- **[SPECS]**: Hardware information logs

### `models/`

Stores the AI models that the assistants use to process requests and generate responses.

- **Model Configurations**: Each model directory, such as `/models/modelA/`, contains a `model.json` with settings specific to that model.

<Callout type="info">
To see the full list of `model.json` parameters, please see [here](/docs/models/model-parameters).
</Callout>

### `settings/`

General settings for the application are stored here, separate from individual assistant or engine configurations.

- **Extension-specific Settings**: Additional settings for extensions are stored in respective subdirectories under `/settings/@janhq/`. Each parameter in the file is defined as follows:

| Parameter       | Description                                                          |

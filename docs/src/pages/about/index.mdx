## About 

We're a team of AI researchers and engineers. We are the creators and lead maintainers of a few open-source AI tools: 

- 👋 [Jan](https://jan.ai): ChatGPT-alternative that runs 100% offline
- 🤖 [Cortex](https://cortex.so/docs/): A simple, embeddable library to run LLMs locally
- More to come! 

<Callout>
The [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club) was an early computer hobbyist group from 1975 to 1986 that led to Apple and the personal computer revolution.

### Mission

We're a robotics company that focuses on the cognitive framework for future robots. Our long-term mission is to advance human-machine collaboration to enable human civilization to thrive.

### Business Model

We're currently a bootstrapped startup [^2]. We balance technical invention with the search for a sustainable business model (e.g., consulting, paid support, and custom development).

## Philosophy

Homebrew is an opinionated company with a clear philosophy for the products we build: 

### 🔑 User Owned

We build tools that are user-owned. Our products are [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), designed to run offline or be [self-hosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/). We make no attempt to lock you in, and our tools are free of [user-hostile dark patterns](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456?t=yGoUuKC9LsNGJxSAKv3Ubg) [^1].

We adopt [Local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) principles and store data locally in [universal file formats](https://stephango.com/file-over-app). We build for privacy by default, and we do not [collect or sell your data](/privacy). 

### 🔧 Right to Tinker

We believe in the [Right to Repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair). We encourage our users to take it further by [tinkering, extending, and customizing](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a4395/pm-remembers-steve-jobs-how-his-philosophy-changed-technology-6507117/) our products to fit their needs. 

Our products are designed with [Extension APIs](/docs/extensions), and we do our best to write good [documentation](/docs) so users understand how things work under the hood. 

### 👫 Build with the Community

We are part of a larger open-source community and are committed to being a good jigsaw puzzle piece. We credit and actively contribute to upstream projects. 

We adopt a public-by-default approach to [Project Management](https://github.com/orgs/janhq/projects/5), [Roadmaps](https://github.com/orgs/janhq/projects/5/views/31), and Helpdesk for our products.

# How We Work

Jan operates on open-source principles, giving everyone the freedom to adjust, personalize, and contribute to its development. Our focus is on creating a community-powered ecosystem that prioritizes transparency, customization, and user privacy. For more on our principles, visit our [About page](https://jan.ai/about).

## Open-Source

We embrace open development, showcasing our progress and upcoming features on GitHub, and we encourage your input and contributions:

- [Jan Framework](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan) (AGPLv3)
- [Jan Desktop Client & Local server](https://jan.ai) (AGPLv3, built on Jan Framework)
- [Nitro: run Local AI](https://github.com/menloresearch/nitro) (AGPLv3)

## Build in Public

We use GitHub to build in public and welcome anyone to join in.

- [Jan's Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/menloresearch/projects/5)
- [Jan's Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/menloresearch/projects/5/views/29)

## Collaboration 

Our team spans the globe, working remotely to bring Jan to life. We coordinate through Discord and GitHub, valuing asynchronous communication and minimal, purposeful meetings. For collaboration and brainstorming, we utilize tools like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and [Miro](https://miro.com/), ensuring alignment and shared vision through visual storytelling and detailed documentation on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/).

Check out the [Jan Framework](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan) and our desktop client & local server at [jan.ai](https://jan.ai), both licensed under AGPLv3 for maximum openness and user freedom.

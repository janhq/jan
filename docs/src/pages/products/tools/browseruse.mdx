## Let Jan Use Your Browser

'BrowserUse' is a native tool being developed for the Jan ecosystem that will allow the AI to securely control a browser to perform tasks, automate workflows, and interact with websites just like a human would.

Think of it as an integrated, privacy-first automation layer that turns Jan from a conversational AI into a powerful agent for action.

### Built on MCP
The tool will be implemented as a native **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server within Jan, ensuring secure and standardized communication between the AI model and the browser.

### Planned Core Features:
- **Secure Sessions** in an isolated, sandboxed environment.
- **Natural Language Control** (e.g., 'Book a flight...')
- **Visual Understanding** to interpret page content.
- **User in the Loop** for critical actions.

## Let Jan Use Your Browser

Jan allows you to give your AI models control of your browser to accomplish tasks automate workflows, and interact with
websites just like you would.

Think of it as an integrated, automation layer that turns Jan from a conversational AI into a powerful agent for action.

### Built on MCP
The tool will be implemented as a native **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server within Jan, ensuring secure and
standardized communication between the AI model and the browser.

### Planned Core Features:
- **Secure Sessions** in an isolated, sandboxed environment.
- **Natural Language Control** (e.g., 'Book a flight...')
- **Visual Understanding** to interpret page content.
- **User in the Loop** for critical actions.

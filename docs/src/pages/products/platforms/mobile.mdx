**Status:** Coming Q4 2025

Jan Mobile brings the same AI experience to your phone. Connect to your desktop, your server, or run models locally.

## How It Works
Jan Mobile adapts to your situation:
- **At Home:** Connect to your Jan Desktop over WiFi.
- **At Work:** Connect to your company Jan Server.
- **On the Go:** Run Jan Nano on your phone or use a cloud model.

## Three Modes, One Experience

### Desktop Mode
Access larger, more powerful models running on your home computer. No phone battery drain.

### Server Mode
Connect to your organization's private AI cloud for team collaboration and access to shared knowledge.

### Local Mode
No connection? No problem. Run models like 'Jan Nano' directly on your phone for complete privacy and offline access.

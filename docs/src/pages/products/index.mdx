Jan is moving from a local AI application to a complete full-stack AI solution that you can self-host. This includes models, applications, and tools that delight users and help them solve their problems.

## What We're Building

**Jan Factory (or Agent)** = Jan Models + Jan Application + Jan Tools

Unlike other AI assistants that do specific tasks with one model or have many models with a myriad of solutions, Jan provides:
- Its own specialised models that are optimised at specific tasks like web-search, creative writing, and translation
- Applications that work across all of your devices in an integrated way
- Tools that actually get things done

## Two Modes, One Experience

### Local (Incognito) Mode
Run AI models entirely on your device, giving you complete privacy with no internet required.

### Cloud Mode
Connect to more powerful models when needed - either self-hosted or via jan.ai.

<Callout type="info" title="Simple Choice">
  Users shouldn't need to understand models, APIs, or technical details. Just choose Local for privacy or Cloud for power.
</Callout>

## Our Product Principles

### 1) It Just Works
1.  Open Jan, start chatting
2.  Onboarding is fully available but optional
3.  Setting up an API key is optional
4.  Selecting a local model is optional
5.  Become a power user at your own pace, if you want to

We handle the complexity.

### 2) Cloud When Needed
Start completely locally and own your AI models. Add cloud capabilities only when you choose to.

### 3) Solve Problems, Not Settings
We help users get to answers quickly, not configuration options. Power users can dig deeper, but it's never required.

## Jan Mobile: Three Modes, One Experience

Jan Mobile brings the same AI experience to your phone. Connect to your desktop, your server, or run models locally.

### How It Works
Jan Mobile adapts to your situation:

- **At Home:** Connect to your Jan Desktop over WiFi. `Your Phone → WiFi → Your Desktop → Response`
- **At Work:** Connect to your company Jan Server. `Your Phone → Internet → Company Server → Response`
- **On the Go:** Run Jan Nano on your phone or talk to your favorite cloud-based model. `Your Phone → Jan Nano (6GB) → Response`

No configuration needed. It just works.

### Key Features
- **Seamless Switching:** Move from home to office to airplane. One-click and Jan adapts immediately.
- **Voice First:** Talk to Jan naturally. Responses can be spoken too.
- **Sync Everything:** Conversations, settings, and preferences follow you across devices.

# How to run AI models locally as a beginner?

Most people think running AI models locally is complicated. It's not. The real complexity lies in believing you need cloud services to use AI. In 2025, anyone can run powerful AI models like DeepSeek, Llama, and Mistral on their own computer. The advantages are significant: complete privacy, no subscription fees, and full control over your AI interactions. This guide will show you how, even if you've never written a line of code.

## Quick steps:
1. Download [Jan](https://jan.ai)
2. Choose a model that fits your hardware
3. Start using AI locally!

Benefits of running AI locally:
- **Privacy:** Your data stays on your device
- **No subscription:** Pay once for hardware
- **Speed:** No internet latency
- **Reliability:** Works offline
- **Full control:** Choose which AI models to use

Before diving deeper, let's be clear: this guide is opinionated. Instead of overwhelming you with every possible option, we'll focus on what actually works for beginners. You'll learn essential local AI terms, and more importantly, get clear recommendations on what to do. No "it depends" answers here - just straightforward guidance based on real experience.

## Understanding Local AI models

Think of AI models like engines powering applications - some are compact and efficient, while others are more powerful but require more resources. Let's understand two important terms you'll see often: parameters and quantization.

### What's a "Parameter"?

When looking at AI models, you'll see names like "Llama-2-7B" or "Mistral-7B". Here's what that means:

- The "B" means "billion parameters" (like brain cells)
- More parameters = smarter AI but needs a faster computer
- Fewer parameters = simpler AI but works on most computers

<Callout type="info">
Which size to choose?
- **7B models:** Best for most people - works on most computers
- **13B models:** Smarter but needs a good graphics card
- **70B models:** Very smart but needs a powerful computer
</Callout>

### What's Quantization?

Quantization is a technique that optimizes AI models to run efficiently on your computer. Think of it like an engine tuning process that balances performance with resource usage:

Simple guide:
- **Q4:** Most efficient choice - good balance of speed and quality
- **Q6:** Enhanced quality with moderate resource usage
- **Q8:** Highest quality but requires more computational power

<Callout type="info">
Understanding model versions:
- **Original models:** Full-sized versions with maximum capability (e.g., original DeepSeek)
- **Distilled models:** Optimized versions that maintain good performance while using fewer resources
- When you see names like "Qwen" or "Llama", these refer to different model architectures and training approaches
</Callout>

Example: A 7B model with Q4 quantization provides an excellent balance for most users.

## Hardware Requirements

Before downloading an AI model, let's check if your computer can run it.

<Callout type="info">
The most important thing is VRAM:
- VRAM is your graphics card's memory
- More VRAM = ability to run bigger AI models
- Most computers have between 4GB to 16GB VRAM
</Callout>

### How to check your VRAM:

**On Windows:**
1. Press Windows + R
2. Type "dxdiag" and press Enter
3. Click "Display" tab
4. Look for "Display Memory"

**On Mac:**
1. Click Apple menu
2. Select "About This Mac"
3. Click "More Info"
4. Look under "Graphics/Displays"

**On Linux:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs)
3. Or: `lspci -v | grep -i vga` (for general GPU info)

### Which models can you run?

Here's a simple guide:

| Your VRAM | What You Can Run | What It Can Do |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 4GB | Small models (1-3B) | Basic writing and questions |
| 6GB | Medium models (7B) | Good for most tasks |
| 8GB | Larger models (13B) | Better understanding |
| 16GB | Largest models (32B) | Best performance |

<Callout type="tip">
Start with smaller models:
- Try 7B models first - they work well for most people
- Test how they run on your computer
- Try larger models only if you need better results
</Callout>

## Setting Up Your Local AI

### 1. Get Started
Download Jan from [jan.ai](https://jan.ai) - it sets everything up for you.

### 2. Get an AI Model

You can get models two ways:

### 1. Use Jan Hub (Recommended):
   - Click "Download Model" in Jan
   - Pick a recommended model
   - Choose one that fits your computer

*Use Jan Hub to download AI models*

### 2. Use Hugging Face:

<Callout type="warning">
Important: Only GGUF models will work with Jan. Make sure to use models that have "GGUF" in their name.
</Callout>

#### Step 1: Get the model link
Find and copy a GGUF model link from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)

![Finding a GGUF model on Hugging Face](./_assets/hugging-face-jan-model-download.jpg)
*Look for models with "GGUF" in their name*

#### Step 2: Open Jan
Launch Jan and go to the Models tab

![Opening Jan's model section](./_assets/jan-library-deepseek-r1.jpg)
*Navigate to the Models section in Jan*

#### Step 3: Add the model
Paste your Hugging Face link into Jan

### Common Questions

<Callout type="info"> 
**"My computer doesn't have a graphics card - can I still use AI?"**
Yes! It will run slower but still work. Start with 7B models.

**"Which model should I start with?"**
Try a 7B model first - it's the best balance of smart and fast.

**"Will it slow down my computer?"**
Only while you're using the AI. Close other big programs for better speed.

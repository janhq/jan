# Private AI for legal professionals who need confidentiality

Yes, it's possible to use AI in legal work without risking client data. ChatGPT or others are not the only way to use AI in law. 

Jan is an privacy-conscious alternative to ChatGPT, it runs AI locally on your laptop/computer, with no files leaving your desk.

If you want to check whether your system can run private AI, see our [AI system requirements guide](/docs/system-requirements).

With Jan, you can create assistants that support your daily work while keeping contracts, case notes, and client files under your full control.  

## What legal professionals can do with AI

- **Contract review**: Highlight unusual clauses, spot ambiguous language, or check for missing terms.  
- **Drafting**: Generate first drafts of NDAs, agreements, or letters that you can refine.  
- **Case prep**: Summarize depositions, discovery files, or judgments into clear briefs.  
- **Knowledge management**: Turn firm memos, policies, and precedents into a searchable knowledge base.  

## Create your own legal assistant in Jan

Jan lets you build assistants with custom instructions. Think of it as a paralegal that follows your exact guidance.  

Here’s a starter prompt you can use:  

> “You are a legal assistant focused on contract analysis. When I paste a contract, highlight risky clauses, note ambiguous language, and give me a short summary in plain English for a client. Do not provide legal advice, only observations.”  

You can expand this to handle drafting, summarizing, or workflows unique to your practice. Over time, refine it with examples so it mirrors your style.  

## Why private AI matters in law

Every lawyer has the same concern: **confidentiality**.  
Cloud-based tools process your text on external servers. Even anonymized input can reveal sensitive details.  

<Callout type="warning">  
Client trust depends on privacy. Sending documents into public AI tools risks compliance and reputation.  
</Callout>  

Private AI keeps everything under your control — no uploads, no leaks.  

## Getting started

1. Install Jan on your device.  
2. Create a custom assistant using the starter prompt above.  
3. Test it first on non-sensitive documents.  
4. Move into client work once you’re confident in the results.  

## Final note

AI in legal practice is not about replacing lawyers. It’s about handling repetitive tasks safely, so you can focus on the decisions that matter.  
With private AI, you get the benefits of automation without compromising client confidentiality.

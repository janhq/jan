# Offline ChatGPT: You can't run ChatGPT offline, do this instead

ChatGPT requires internet because it runs on OpenAI's servers. For offline AI, you need local models running on your computer.

The fastest way: [Jan](https://jan.ai/) - a free, open-source ChatGPT alternative that works 100% offline on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

**3 steps to get started:**

1. Download Jan (free, works offline)
2. Download an AI model  
3. Start chatting without internet

The guide below shows you exactly how, plus answers common questions about offline AI.

## Can you download ChatGPT for offline use?

No. ChatGPT is cloud-only and always requires internet. OpenAI doesn't offer an offline download.

**The solution:** Download Jan and use offline AI models that work like ChatGPT - just without needing internet.

| Platform | Download | Works Offline |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Windows | [jan.exe](https://jan.ai) | ✓ |
| macOS | [jan.dmg](https://jan.ai) | ✓ |
| Linux | [jan.AppImage](https://jan.ai) | ✓ |

## How to use AI offline?

Offline AI means the model runs on your computer. So no internet needed, 100% private, and data never leaves your device. With Jan you can run offline AI models locally.

## Jan as an offline ChatGPT replacement

### 2. Download an AI model

You'll need an AI model to use AI offline, so download a model from Jan. Once it's on your computer, you don't need internet anymore. You can also use GPT models via Jan - check [running gpt-oss locally](https://www.jan.ai/post/run-gpt-oss-locally) post to see it.

*Select an AI model that matches your needs and computer capabilities*

### Which model should you choose?

- For most computers: Try Mistral 7B or DeepSeek - they're similar to ChatGPT 3.5
- For older computers: Use smaller 3B models
- For gaming PCs: You can try larger 13B models

## How to chat with your docs in Jan?

Simply add your files and ask questions about them.

![Chat with your documents using Jan](./_assets/chat-with-docs-prompt.jpg "Ask questions about your documents offline")
*Chat with your documents privately - no internet needed*

I did this for you and got a reply from a 7B parameter model. If you'd like to learn what "7B" means and understand other local AI terms, check our [guide on running AI models locally](/post/run-ai-models-locally).

A response from AI, Qwen2.5 7B Instruct Q4:

`This document appears to be about the benefits and advantages of running artificial intelligence (AI) models locally on your device rather than using cloud-based or remote AI services. The key points it highlights include data privacy, offline functionality, freedom from paywalls and restrictions, and giving users full control over their AI models. Additionally, the text mentions that local AI is becoming a new trend and provides a link to a guide for beginners who want to learn more about this topic.`

Local AI makes possible offline AI use, so Jan is going to be your first step to get started. 

## Why choose Jan over ChatGPT?

1. **True Offline Use:** Unlike ChatGPT, Jan works without internet
2. **100% Private:** Your data never leaves your computer
3. **Free Forever:** No subscriptions or API costs
4. **No Server Issues:** No more "ChatGPT is at capacity"
5. **Your Choice of Models:** Use newer models as they come out

### "Is Jan really free? What's the catch?"

Jan is completely free and open source. Built by developers who believe AI should be accessible to everyone. No subscriptions, no hidden costs.

### How does Jan compare to ChatGPT?"
Modern open-source models like DeepSeek and Mistral are very capable. While they might not match GPT-4, they're perfect for most tasks and getting better every month.

### "Do I need a powerful computer?"
If your computer is from the last 5 years, it will likely work fine. You need about 8GB of RAM and 10GB of free space for comfortable usage.

### "What about my privacy?"
Everything stays on your computer with Jan. Your conversations, documents, and data never leave your device unless you choose to share them.

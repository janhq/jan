# AI for teachers who care about student privacy

![AI for teachers](/assets/images/general/ai-for-teacher.jpeg)

AI can help teachers handle the work that piles up outside class. It can draft a lesson outline, suggest feedback on essays, or turn notes into a polite parent email. These are the tasks that usually stretch into evenings and weekends.

Most AI tools like ChatGPT run in the cloud. Sharing lesson plans, student writing, or parent details there risks compliance and trust.

## Lesson planning assistant  

AI can draft lesson outlines in minutes. You adapt and refine them for your students.  

**Prompt for Jan:**  
> You are a lesson planning assistant.  
> When I give you a topic or subject:  
> - Suggest a lesson outline with objectives, activities, and discussion questions  
> - Adjust for different grade levels if I specify  
> - Keep plans practical and realistic for a classroom setting  

Example ask: For Grade 6 science on ecosystems. Objectives: define food chains, explain producer/consumer roles. Activity: group poster on an ecosystem. Questions: How would removing one species affect the whole system?

## Grading support assistant  

AI won't replace your judgment, but it can make feedback faster and more consistent.  

**Prompt for Jan:**  
> You are a grading support assistant.  
> When I paste student writing or answers:  
> - Highlight strengths and areas for improvement  
> - Suggest short, constructive feedback I can reuse  
> - Keep tone supportive and professional  
> Do not assign final grades.  

Example: For a history essay. Strength: clear thesis. Improvement: weak evidence. Feedback: "Great thesis and structure. Next time, support your points with specific historical examples."

## Parent communication assistant  

Writing parent emails is important but time-consuming.  

**Prompt for Jan:**

> When I give you key points about a student:  
> - Draft a polite and empathetic email to parents  
> - Use clear and professional language  
> - Keep tone supportive, not overly formal  
> Only include details I provide.

## gpt-oss Performance & Troubleshooting

### Expected Performance Benchmarks

| Hardware Setup | First Response | Subsequent Responses | Tokens/Second |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **16GB RAM + CPU only** | 30-45 seconds | 3-6 seconds | 3-8 tokens/sec |
| **32GB RAM + RTX 3060** | 15-25 seconds | 1-3 seconds | 15-25 tokens/sec |
| **32GB RAM + RTX 4080+** | 8-15 seconds | 1-2 seconds | 25-45 tokens/sec |

### Common Issues & Solutions

Performance optimization tips:
- First response is slow: Normal - kernels compile once, then speed up dramatically
- Out of VRAM error: Reduce context length in settings or switch to CPU mode
- Out of memory: Close memory-heavy apps (Chrome, games, video editors)
- Slow responses: Check if other apps are using GPU/CPU heavily

Quick fixes:
1. Restart Jan if responses become slow
2. Lower context window from 4096 to 2048 tokens
3. Enable CPU mode if GPU issues persist
4. Free up RAM by closing unused applications

## Skip the downtime with Jan

When ChatGPT is down, Jan keeps working. Jan is an open-source ChatGPT alternative that runs on your computer - no servers, no outages, no waiting.

![Jan running when ChatGPT is down](/assets/images/general/is-chatgpt-down.jpg)
*Jan works even when ChatGPT doesn't.*

### Why Jan never goes down:
- **Runs locally** - No dependency on external servers
- **Always available** - Works offline, even on flights
- **No capacity limits** - Uses your computer's resources
- **100% private** - Your conversations stay on your device

### Get started in 3 mins:
1. Download Jan: [jan.ai](https://jan.ai)
2. Install a model: Choose from Jan, Qwen, or other top models
3. Start chatting: Similar design as ChatGPT, but always available if you use local models

<Callout type="info">
**Pro tip:** Keep both ChatGPT and Jan. You'll never lose productivity to outages again.
</Callout>

Jan runs AI models locally, so you don't need internet access. That means Jan is unaffected when ChatGPT is down.

### Why does ChatGPT goes down?
There could be multiple reasons:
- Too many users at once
- Data center or API downtime
- Planned or uplanned updates 
- Limited in some locations

ChatGPT depends on OpenAI’s servers. If those go down, so does ChatGPT. Jan users don't affect by ChatGPT's outage.

### Common ChatGPT Errors

When ChatGPT experiences issues, you might see these error messages:

- "ChatGPT is at capacity right now": Too many users online, try again later
- "Error in message stream": Connection problems with OpenAI servers
- "Something went wrong": General server error, refresh and retry
- "Network error": Internet connectivity issues on your end or OpenAI's
- "Rate limit exceeded": Too many requests sent, wait before trying again
- "This model is currently overloaded": High demand for specific model

# Jan Handbook

> Jan's Handbook is inspired by [Posthog](https://posthog.com/handbook) and [Gitlab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/).
> Thank you for showing us the way.

## Welcome

This handbook explains how [Jan](https://jan.ai) works, and is public.

We're building superintelligence that you can self-host and use locally. Not as a limitation, but as a feature. Your AI should work wherever you need it - on your laptop during a flight, on your company's servers for compliance, or in the cloud for scale.

Jan's Handbook is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document), constantly evolving as we build the future of AI ownership.

## Why does Jan exist?

- [Open Superintelligence](/handbook/open-superintelligence) - Building superintelligence that belongs to everyone, not just a few tech giants. We believe the future of AI should be open, accessible, and owned by the people who use it.
- [Betting on Open-Source](/handbook/betting-on-open-source)
Why we're betting on open-source as the future of AI and technology. Open-source has consistently won in the long term, and AI will be no different.

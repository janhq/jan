# Jan Handbook
> Jan's Handbook is inspired by [Posthog](https://posthog.com/handbook) and [Gitlab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/). Thanks for showing us the way.

## Welcome

Welcome to [Jan](https://jan.ai)!

This handbook explains what Jan is, what we stand for, and how you can be part of it.

Jan is built in public by a team that believes AI should get things done, not just talk about getting things done. We're open source, we move fast, and we build alongside the people using what we make.

This handbook is a living thing. It grows as Jan grows - new ideas, new tools, new ways to make AI that actually works for you.

## Overview

Jan is a general purpose AI agent that works on its own to get things done.

Give Jan something to work on, maybe research for a brief, a report you have been putting off, or an analysis you need to pull together, and it will run for as long as needed. It could be five hours or ten. Jan figures it out, does the work, and finishes the job.

Think of it like this: you hand off the task, Jan handles it, and you get on with your day.

Jan is open source and built by a vibrant global community. Anyone can use it, contribute to it, or host it themselves.

Jan gets it done. That is the whole idea.

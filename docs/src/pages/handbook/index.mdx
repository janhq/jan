# Jan Handbook

> Jan's Handbook is inspired by [Posthog](https://posthog.com/handbook) and [Gitlab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/).
> Thank you for showing us the way.

## Welcome

This handbook explains how [Jan](https://jan.ai) works, and is public.

We're building superintelligence that you can self-host and use locally. Not as a limitation, but as a feature. Your AI should work wherever you need it - on your laptop during a flight, on your company's servers for compliance, or in the cloud for scale.

Jan's Handbook is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document), constantly evolving as we build the future of AI ownership.

## Our North Star

We're building superintelligence that:

- **Works anywhere**: From your laptop to your data center
- **Belongs to you**: Download it, own it, modify it
- **Scales infinitely**: One person or ten thousand, same platform
- **Improves constantly**: Community-driven development

This isn't just about making AI accessible. It's about ensuring the most transformative technology in human history can be owned by those who use it.

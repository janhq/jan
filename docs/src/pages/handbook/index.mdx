# Jan Handbook

> Jan's Handbook is inspired by [Posthog](https://posthog.com/handbook) and [Gitlab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/).
> Thank you for showing us the way.

## Welcome

This handbook explains how [Jan](https://jan.ai) works, and is public.

We're building superintelligence that you can self-host and use locally. Not as a limitation, but as a feature. Your AI should work wherever you need it - on your laptop during a flight, on your company's servers for compliance, or in the cloud for scale.

Jan's Handbook is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document), constantly evolving as we build the future of AI ownership.

## Why does Jan exist?

### [Open Superintelligence](/handbook/open-superintelligence)
Building superintelligence that belongs to everyone, not just a few tech giants. We believe the future of AI should be open, accessible, and owned by the people who use it.

### [Betting on Open-Source](/handbook/betting-on-open-source)
Why we're betting on open-source as the future of AI and technology. Open-source has consistently won in the long term, and AI will be no different.

## Our North Star

We're building superintelligence that:

- **Works anywhere**: From your laptop to your data center
- **Belongs to you**: Download it, own it, modify it
- **Scales infinitely**: One person or ten thousand, same platform
- **Improves constantly**: Community-driven development

This isn't just about making AI accessible. It's about ensuring the most transformative technology in human history can be owned by those who use it.

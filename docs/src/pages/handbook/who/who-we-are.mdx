# Who We Are

We're building Jan because we believe AI agents should get things done for everyone, everywhere - not just serve a handful of markets or companies.

## Our team

We hire from unconventional backgrounds because we know talent is everywhere but opportunity isn't. Our team includes people who've taken non-traditional paths into tech - and we think that diversity of experience leads to better lateral thinking and sharper problem-solving.

We're a small team, mostly based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Being outside the usual tech hubs means we see problems and opportunities others miss. We're building for markets and users that don't fit the standard Silicon Valley playbook.

## What guides us

We're solarpunk optimists. We think technology can genuinely improve life when it's built openly, with the right intent, and by people who care about making something useful.

We believe AI should serve humanity, not nations or corporate interests. That's why Jan is open source and built with a global community.

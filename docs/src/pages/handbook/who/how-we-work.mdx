# How We Work

Jan is a distributed team. Some of us work remotely, though our home base is in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, right on [Nguyen Hue Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NguyenHueStreet). We meet in person when it helps us think better together.

We keep things simple:

* Write things down
* Share early and often  
* Make decisions visible
* Ship first, refine after

## Own the work

We trust people to do great work without micromanagement. Owning the work means treating Jan like it's yours - you take initiative, follow through, and help teammates succeed.

**What this looks like:**

* Pick up problems without being asked
* Finish what you start
* Take responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks

## Build in public

Our code, plans, and discussions are mostly open. We default to transparency because open work builds better products and earns trust. When everyone can see how things work, everyone can help make them better.

**What this looks like:**

* Default to sharing
* Give and receive feedback openly (and kindly)
* Explain your decisions so others can learn

## Who thrives here

We don't care about perfect profiles or pedigree. We care about people who:

* Ship things
* Care about the outcome
* Want to build something genuinely useful
* Learn fast by doing, not debating

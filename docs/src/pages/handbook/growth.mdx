# How we grow

> People care less about what you are and more about what they can get until you invite them into a purpose they share. 

Jan averages 7,000 downloads per day and gets millions of impressions on social media. 150+ people join [our community](https://discord.gg/Exe46xPMbK) each week. All with $0 spent on ads. 

We grow because the product is useful today and the purpose is bigger than the product. Jan takes the best of open-source AI and packages it into an easy-to-use product, with a long game: [Open Superintelligence](/handbook/why) that can run on a $1,000 laptop.

Growth happens when the right thing matches the right people with the right emotions. So it starts with the product, and the work is to make something genuinely useful, show how it works, and let others build with us. When the product helps today and can be explored tomorrow, word of mouth does most of the lifting.

## Attention is all you need
*Really, even for growth.*

Modern life is a contest for attention. We show up where attention lives; docs, code, short posts, meetups, and we show up often. 

A useful lens for how we communicate comes from philosopher [Ted Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cohen_(philosopher))'s view of jokes: they land when teller and audience share background that stays unstated, and recognition clicks mid-story. 

Product communication works the same way. We start from problems people already know, make a small, concrete move, and let the recognition carry the message. The best punchline is a message or visual that evokes and connects something in viewers' minds.

That's our approach to growing on the path to Open Superintelligence.

# What is Jan
Jan is both a product suite and a family of models we train in-house:

## Applications:

We're building Jan to work wherever you do. Jan is available on:

* [Desktop](https://www.jan.ai/download)
* [Browser](https://chat.jan.ai/)
* Browser Extension (coming soon)
* Jan Server

Whether you prefer working from your desktop, need quick access through your browser, or want Jan on the go with mobile - use it however makes sense for you.

Over time, we expect most people will use Jan through the browser as we continue improving the web experience. 

## Models:

* Jan-v2: our multimodal agent built for long-horizon tasks
* Jan-v1: web search capabilities
* Ichigo: speech AI for voice interactions

Training our own models means we can optimise for how agents actually work - planning, executing, and completing tasks autonomously over hours, not just answering questions.

This won't be easy. Building agents that work reliably for hours - sometimes 5, sometimes 10 - without supervision is genuinely hard. We're still early. But the problem is real, the technology is ready, and we think this is the right direction.

## Highlights 🎉

v0.6.8 focuses on stability and real workflows: major llama.cpp hardening, two new MCP productivity tutorials, new model pages, and a cleaner docs structure.


### 🚀 New tutorials & docs

- Linear MCP tutorial: create/update issues, projects, comments, cycles — directly from chat
- Todoist MCP tutorial: add, list, update, complete, and delete tasks via natural language
- New model pages:
  - Lucy (1.7B) — optimized for web_search tool calling
  - Jan‑v1 (4B) — strong SimpleQA (91.1%), solid tool use
- Docs updates:
  - Reorganized landing and Products sections; streamlined QuickStart
  - Ongoing Docs v2 (Astro) migration with handbook, blog, and changelog sections added and then removed

### 🧱 Llama.cpp engine: stability & correctness

- Device parsing tests; conditional Vulkan support; support for missing CUDA backends
- AVX2 instruction support check (Mac Intel) for MCP
- Server hang on model load — fixed
- Session management & port allocation moved to backend for robustness
- Recommended labels in settings; per‑model Jinja template customization

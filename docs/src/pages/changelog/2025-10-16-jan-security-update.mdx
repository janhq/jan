## Jan v0.7.2: Security Update (happy-dom v20)

This release focuses on **security and stability improvements**.  
It updates the `happy-dom` dependency to the latest version to address a recently disclosed vulnerability.

### Security Fix
- Updated `happy-dom` to **^20.0.0**, preventing untrusted JavaScript executed within HAPPY DOM from accessing process-level functions and executing arbitrary code outside the intended sandbox.

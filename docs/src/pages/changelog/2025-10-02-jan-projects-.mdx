## Jan v0.7.0: Jan Projects

Jan v0.7.0 is live! This release focuses on helping you organize your workspace and making models run more efficiently.  

### What’s new
- **Projects**: Group related chats under one project for a cleaner workflow.  
- **Rename models**: Give your models custom names for easier identification.  
- **Model context stats**: See context usage when a model runs.  
- **Automatic llama.cpp tuning**: Jan now adjusts settings such as context size and GPU layers based on your hardware, so local models run more efficiently out of the box.  
- **Auto-loaded cloud models**: Cloud model names now appear automatically, with support for Azure as a provider.  

Update your Jan or [download the latest version](https://jan.ai/).

You are going to test the Jan application by verifying that the hardware information is displayed correctly in the Settings panel.

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Given the Jan application is already opened.
2. In the bottom-left menu, click on **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Hardware**.

4. In the main panel, ensure the following sections are displayed clearly with appropriate system information:

---

**Operating System**
- This section should display:
  - A name such as "Windows", "Ubuntu", or "Macos"
  - A version string like "Windows 11 Pro", "22.04.5 LTS", or "macOS 15.5 Sequoia"

---

**CPU**
- This section should display:
  - A processor model (e.g., Intel, AMD, or Apple Silicon)
  - An architecture (e.g., x86_64, amd64, or aarch64)
  - A number of cores
  - Optional: An instruction set list (may appear on Linux or Windows)
  - A usage bar indicating current CPU load

---

**Memory**
- This section should display:
  - Total RAM
  - Available RAM
  - A usage bar showing memory consumption

---

**GPUs**
- This section is located at the bottom of the Hardware page — **scroll down if it is not immediately visible**.
- If the system has a GPU:
  - It should display the GPU name (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080)
  - A toggle should be available to enable or disable GPU usage
- If no GPU is detected:
  - It should display a message like “No GPUs detected”

---

**Final Check**
- Ensure that there are **no error messages** in the UI.
- The layout should appear clean and correctly rendered with no broken visual elements.

If all sections display relevant hardware information accurately and the interface is error-free, return:
{"result": true}

Otherwise, return:
{"result": false}

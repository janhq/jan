# The Fast and the Curious

> "The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else." — Eric Ries

We hire people who are both fast and curious—those who move quickly, take action, and never stop learning.

## Ship Fast

- We launched a new product every two weeks—build, assess, and decide to kill or double down
- From a StableDiffusion app to R&D lab—we evolve fast
- Execution matters more than ideas
- The best people get things done, not just talk about it
- We look for individuals who are hungry—driven, proactive, and biased toward action

## Stay Curious

- Learning never stops. The best people continuously improve and adapt
- We believe if you know how to learn, you don't need a teacher, a degree, or a title
- We hire those with relentlessness—people who push themselves beyond comfort zones
- A year from now, their skill set will be different—evolved, expanded, and sharpened

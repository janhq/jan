# Lateral Thinking using Withered Technology

<br />

<Youtube id="E-4XySE15zM?feature=shared" />

> "You're better off picking a cheap technology ('withered') and using it in a new way ('lateral') rather than going for the predictable, cutting-edge next step." — [Nintendo's Philosophy](https://medium.com/@adamagb/nintendo-s-little-known-product-philosophy-lateral-thinking-with-withered-technology-bac7257d8f4)

## Taking the long view

- AI is in a rapid innovation phase
- Staying grounded is essential as technologies shift and new tools emerge
- We focus on what endures
- Shiny objects can distract, we prioritize lasting value over hype
- We aim to be relevant in 10 years, long-term thinking guides what we build and how we invest

## Lateral thinking with withered technology

- Solve real problems at affordable prices
- Constraints drive creativity
- [Frugality](/handbook/money/how#frugality) is a strategy
- Use validated, abundant, and well-understood tech
  - We ship hardware with default A6000s
  - Prioritize cost-effective materials without sacrificing quality
- Optimize for accessibility over perfection

<br/>

## Why we do this

- Resources are limited, but creativity isn't
- Smart choices let us do more with less
- Frugality enables longevity
- We build for people, not for accolades

## How we operate
 
- Fail cheaply
- Launch early
- Iterate often
- Lower experimentation costs
- Prioritize global accessibility through cost-efficiency
- Focus on essential product features

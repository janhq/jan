title: How We Communicate
---

We're a small, fully-remote team spanning 4 continents and 9 cultures. To make this work, here are some guidelines.

### Expectations

- **Assume Hanlon’s Razor**: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ~~stupidity~~ lack of communication or ambiguity.”
- **Ask Stupid Questions**: If you're not sure, ask. We are all learning. 
- **Boil the Ocean into a Single Droplet**: We trust you to tackle ambiguity and complexity head-on. Share the insights, abstract the details.
> Tip: "I've been thinking about X, and I think we should do Y because Z. What do you think?"
- **Documentation First**: Start with a pull request. Overcomment your code. Publish changes to docs.
- **Async Communication over Meetings**: If you schedule a meeting, there should be a clear agenda & outcome. 
> Tip: spend the first 10 minutes of the meeting reading over **prepared materials**. This way, everyone is well informed and can arrive at a better discussion/decision.

## Offboarding

We are grateful for the time you spent with us. In many cases, you have moved on to start your own companies or to pursue your life's work. We'll be cheering you on from the sidelines and hope you remain part of the Menlo community.

To ensure a seamless transition, we've outlined our offboarding process below.

### Notice Period

For voluntary departures past the probation period, we ask for 45 days notice both ways. This is to ensure a smooth transition for the team. We understand that this may not always be possible and will work with you to find a solution.

### Final Pay

Final pay & reimbursements will be processed at the end of the month with regular payroll. Unused vacations, equipment, and other considerations will also be netted in the final pay.

In terms of ESOP, we understand that most people are not in a position to exercise their options within a 90 day period. As a gesture of goodwill, we often grant a lengthy exercise period for good leavers. This is at the discretion of the board and is not guaranteed.

### Checklist

- Arrange to return equipment. If you wish to keep your equipment at a discounted rate, please inform HR.
- Assign all ongoing projects & Github issues to a team member.
- Optional: good leavers may request a recommendation letter from HR.
- Optional: request an exit interview to provide feedback on your experience at Menlo.

# Who are we building for?

We focus on two types of customers: 

1. Hobbyists
2. Businesses with "must-have" use-cases

## Hobbyists

There are many hobbyists who tinker with Robotics and AI as passion projects. We build for this group because:

- They actually use our tools 
- They give us blunt feedback on how to improve

We may not make money on directly from hobbyists. However, we are betting on the long-term, where hobbyists become organizational champions.

If we can be the best tool for hobbyists, we will be the best tool for paying users.

## "Must-have" use-cases

We focus on "must-have" use-cases:

- Nobody wants to do
- Too dangerous for humans to do
- or, can be done 10x cheaper/better/reliably by a robot

We avoid:

- "Nice-to-have"
- Corporate vanity use cases

## Performance Art

We may sometimes do "performance art". This is where we build something that is not profitable, but helps communicate our vision:

- These is a marketing expense
- We should not mistake virality for [product-market fit](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-market-fit/)
- Should ideally be covered by grants or sponsorships

Robotics is prone to hype and grandoise claims. We need to focus on creating real value for customers.

## What is our moat?

We fundamentally believe that our moat is our team's ability to continually innovate: 

- Culture of curiosity
- Inventing new products
- Recovering from failure
- Attracting next generation of talent

### Inspiration

> In the face of disruptive technologies, moats created by closed source are temporary. Even OpenAI’s closed source approach can’t prevent others from catching up. 
> 
> So we anchor our value in our team — our colleagues grow through this process, accumulate know-how, and form an organization and culture capable of innovation. That’s our moat.
